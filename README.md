# SATHAME
semi-automated tool helping analyse model errors - bachelor thesis HU Berlin

## Motivation

Related work in error analysis for language models indicates few standards and best practices.
The available tools lead many projects toward manual error analysis, which is time-consuming and tedious.
This tool aims to provide a starting point for developers of any skill level. 
You create some error categories and label a few errors for each category, and a sentence transformer combined with a classifier head does the rest.
A generated schema then indicates the following steps and areas that promise significant results worth your time.

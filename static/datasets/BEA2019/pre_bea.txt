0003###I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
0004###It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
0006###I think that the public transport will always be in the future .
0007###The rich people will buy a car but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
0008###I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
0009###Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
0010###In my experience when I did n't have a car I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
0012###In India we have various types of Public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Car , Train & Flight .
0013###Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
0015###This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .
0017###We have stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
0018###Since , we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & Flight ) .
0019###In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
0020###Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
0024###I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . also , I organized many sports activities before in my school .
0026###My family think that my cook is amazing .
0027###I hope that you give my the chance to join you .
0029###My favourite sport is volleyball because I love plays with my friends .
0030###Volleyball is a sport play every place , when I travel on the beach I like plays with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
0031###It is very funny .
0032###when I was young I like plays with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
0034###How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country .
0035###On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of place to travel .
0040###On the other hand , in my country there are a few job because the economy is very bad .
0041###But , if you want I look for a job from you .
0042###My best friend looking for a people responsible for look after her sister .
0043###Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after every weekend .
0044###You will be interesting in this job ?
0048###Today public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .
0049###Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
0050###Also people need not to suffer high operating cost running their own car .
0051###But it can use a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is far away from home .
0052###For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
0053###Instead it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on public plane .
0054###In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .
0055###If we think about it the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them has we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way car cust more money than the public transport .
0056###By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport .
0057###If I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably chose car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .
0059###We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
0060###In some strategic points of the building we have special trashcans to separate the garbage in organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles and they also made talks and presentations about the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
0061###The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
0062###All this initiatives has made us all over the years a recognised ecological community .
0063###Good morning everyone , today I want to share about is my favorite sport .
0064###My favorite sport is football , why I choose it?Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .
0065###I believe that 's all will delighted us .
0066###By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United , they are brilliant , they have an amazing football players , and they are awesome .
0067###Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was : Be a super hero !
0068###After many years he still dream to become a super hero .
0069###He enter the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession was the more similar to be a super hero .
0070###Pass some years of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him .
0071###Kate was cursing the university of fashion .
0073###Michael and Kate was so happy , until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero , Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero do n't exist .
0074###When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad saying that she was lying and do n't have heart .
0076###In following day , she said sorry and them was happy again .
0077###But when them get to the home of Michael they fight again and Michael get a knife and kill her .
0078###He cried with a lot blood around .
0079###Michael get away from there .
0081###Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings amount of benefits in our life .
0082###For instance , we take subway in order to avoid stocking in traffic .
0083###It is true that moving by car is more convenient than take public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our life and harm our environment .
0087###In my country , taipei , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
0088###I can not imagine if there is no bus or MRT , how long I will take for school .
0089###Car is convenient for human , but it brings damage for human also .
0090###For example , carbon dioxide which is created by car .
0091###It cause global warming which threats our environment and harms our daily life .
0092###we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades , such as typhoon , hurricane , wild fire and mud slide .
0096###Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process will be started right away
0099###Every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to do an international travel ?
0101###But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very carefuly at time to get off a plane .
0104###Although , the better option , is pick out a train .
0105###There is n't comparation on watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
0107###The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
0108###Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible
0109###In modern societies , there are lots of friends around our daily lives .
0110###Big project could not be finished without co - operations .
0111###Friends could be communicated and exchanged the ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .
0112###More importantly , the parents give our lives and they touch us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
0113###In this case , the families played important roles in daily lives .
0115###First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
0116###For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from parents .
0117###Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
0118###If difficulties was told to the families , the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
0119###All in all , in this case , the families are the most important friends in our lives .
0120###The Computing Technology has been advancing very much this last years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better and making the difference between old and new computers grow even more with every new discoverement .
0121###As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , starting from the size of the computers , old computers were much bigger than new computers .
0122###Old computers were used to occupy one entire room , now , they only have the size of a box , even the size of a book .
0124###Old computers only let you make math tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videogames , writing or reading a book , connect to the internet , watch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve the Computing Technology , and not only in 2 colors , but thousand of them .
0127###I went to the abandon house and started to think the best way to make his life miserable i passed the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him sufer .
0128###As i did n't found nothing , i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea , i would drive him crazy just as he did with me , that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united , so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death , jus as he did with me !
0129###But wait a minute am i really so angry to make this ?
0131###I screamed , my anger had dominated my mind i did nt had no longer control over my actions , i was afarid of what i had become and what i could do , but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange , the best revange .
0132###But i was so mad at him and so ansiouns to make his life imposible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering i had been throug became stronger and bigger , i had made a desition i was goingo to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him to have a miserable life and i wo nt stop until i had acomplished my goald

0163###public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
0164###before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end
0165###nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places
0166###to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used
0167###The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
0168###This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture , scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years
0169###Development of biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth .
0170###A large scale of investment was bring for biofuel development .
0171###Meanwhile , it boost economic growth and jobs opportunity , thereby enhance Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
0172###If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town , is environment .
0173###Global warming is huge issue in today 's date .
0174###Government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
0175###However we the people have really important part of making it worse .
0176###Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
0177###Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city .
0178###Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government .
0179###People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere .
0181###Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public area and under 18 year old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
0182###In conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbour cities to taking part of cleaning environment so one day it can be seen in whole country .
0185###On our school or villiage football stadium i spend a lot of time every day .
0186###Usually i play football with my classmates .
0187###Before training i ran 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs get a power and my body gets an energy .
0188###Our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us , how to improve football skills .
0189###His main words:"You must work and work very hard , if you want to get high results " .
0190###I can say , that coach is experienced person .
0192###The first place was gotting by us .
0193###We have achieved this result , because we are friendly and organised .
0196###I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport:"You must believe in yorself " .
0197###Hallo my firend ,
0201###It 's really nice for your expressly e - mail yesterday .
0204###I have seen your notice in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
0206###Although I came to Spain ten years later so I can speak with them in Spanish if it was necessary .
0207###Also , I assisted to a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
0208###It was a lot of time ago , however , I still keep the rhthym in my body !
0209###By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
0210###All members congratulated me , as well .
0212###You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and funny person .
0213###That makes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or the hobby for me !
0214###I hope you keep in mind my candidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
0216###In my opinion public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in demand .
0218###Besides there are lots of low income people who ca n't buy their own car .
0221###In my opinion , Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each .
0222###In the Taiwan , many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old , but the point is what if you can not survival , I mean you do n't have enough money to raise you parent .
0223###Back to the topic , I do n't know well any of member of in my family , I do n't trust them , honestly .
0227###That 's why I order all of you to go there and feel the pleasure and have a try their own food .
0228###You can also bought a lot of gifts like key chains , statue , or what else memories to be made before returning to Malaysia .
0229###I did not have to go to NewZealand but believe me it is very beautiful place .
0230###If I have sustenance , I will go there and bring all of you .
0232###The local Council hasn't a project for the environment .
0233###People collect any kind of rubbish and throws all together in black sack .
0234###Although the Council began to plan something , the people are n't committed with the problem .
0235###Around the city , you can find many places where the people throw frigo , kitchen , " amianto " , old things or furniture .
0239###When I was a child , I had a lot friends and they were very important for me .
0240###We ever played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laugh a lot of ...
0241###But when I was a teenager I began to live situations that I did not like it , for instance , the girls said to me bad things or they talked bad about me .
0242###In those years I lived the worst moments in my life .
0243###I remember when I celebreted my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party ; I think that this day was one of the worst day of my life .
0244###There night I cried because I felt that I have not got any friends .
0245###However , my parents tried that my party was the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and together went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents .
0247###I knew that they never talk bad about me .
0252###Both like to travel around the world and to practise some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekking .
0253###We like watching TV series and cooking several desserts too .
0254###To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , David , my husband .
0255###Life of people around the globe is becoming busier and busier day by day .
0256###A busy life always compell to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation system lag behind motor cars .
0257###Hi USA SUMMER CAMPS ,
0261###I am sure that I will look after children very well .
0262###I would like to speak English perfectly so I think up the idea about if I work in summer camps , I will improve my level English .
0264###I am waiting yours answer .
0271###The lessons are very funny
0273###I have seen your announcement in the newspaper and I am interested to apply for .
0274###I can speak English and I am a lovely , energetic and hardworking person besides I have recommended paper from
0276###I have been working like a childhood teacher in a school and I am qualified .
0277###Besides I have cooking skills and I love to cook .
0281###the tecnology have chanched the people 's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life.for example my parents did n't whacth on tv , because there was n't any tv on the world when they were young.but it is n't the alone difference : we can think at the mobilefone , the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life .
0282###Although the fact that personal vehicle like car now is popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
0283###Nowaday , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing , this source of energy does n't always maintain at the constant level , but someday it will be run out .
0284###People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity , wind power , public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of energy .
0285###As a result , governments will invest more in researching the usage of these new types of energy , travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car .
0286###The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas , it become much more convenient .
0287###Commuting , travelling using public services will be the first prior choice .
0288###In addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to many other problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air pollution .
0289###In some perespectives , these problems are led by the over - using of personal vehicle .
0290###People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic jams or to gradually killing themselves for breathing polluted air .
0291###So the best way for them to travel is public transpotations .
0292###Each person should practice saving when using any source of eneny to protect his own live .
0293###In conclusion , investments on developing public transport will be increased considerably , public services of travelling have a bright potential and it 's stance in the future ca n't be replaceble
0295###Are you free for weckend , have you any plans .
0296###Me and my friends go to the cinema , and I invite you to go with us .
0297###If you are interesedt , find me at 8 clock near the cinema entrance .
0299###I always want to read these type of book .
0300###I went to temple in the morning followed by lunch at the hotel latter in the evening went to the beach .
0301###In conclusion it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel for better education prospects and stable environment for younger generation to grow up .
0302###The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
0303###The cause of Brain - drain should be tackled at international and national level on a broader dimensions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
0304###In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting up the infrastructure and law enforcement to support public in a positive manner .
0306###Jordan Romero has got 13 when he climbed Everest in May 2010 .
0309###My friends and I , we like a programs of TV , electronic music , fashionable clothes . I prefer all .
0310###Sometimes we are going to the party 's in the city , I am dancing in the party with my friends .
0311###They listen to the music and can we are singing .
0313###Jason is my friend , he is drunk and also he dance with your girfriend .
0314###Jose is the best song . he is singing and talking in the party .
0315###Other person is Angel , he do n't dance in all place .
0316###He prefer study in your home .
0317###Hello Something .
0319###In the moment I visit the Secondary modern school .
0322###For example there are girl she is in my class she is beautiful .
0325###But she is ignored me .
0329###I like to running fast so fast in fact that it feel me as if I run on air and the feet do not hardly touch the ground between the strides .
0331###I am likeing to feel the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
0332###The bestest advice I can giving to someone who is starting the running is to starting slowly and not to try to run too fast but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little more further and a little more faster and then after 20 years you will be an Olympic champion maybe .
0335###If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it hardly will have any educational value .
0337###A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apokalyspe should happen he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in that case .
0340###It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
0342###In the last few years forensic biology has developed many aspects like better sensibility , robustness of results and less time required for analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
0345###From my experience knowledge , I believe television cover both entertaining and educational functions .
0346###It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learn different basics from a great deal number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
0348###Apart from eduational contents , there are so many foul contents , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .
0350###I think who the best restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
0351###Here we can eat typical Italian food .
0352###The last time who I was here I have eat the best pizza that I have ever eat in my life .
0353###The atmosphere remind the theme of the sea in fact the walls are decorating with a lot of shell and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
0354###Also , It 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit all together at the same table .
0355###the owner is a very kind person and I 'm sure who he makes us a convenience price .
0357###Public transport is the cheaper way of travel , so it has future .
0358###Currently , most people is used to use their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
0360###So , if people were aware of this subject would n't use so much their own car .
0362###First of all you need can afford to buy it , after that , you must pay for the asurance , council tax , and mechanic bills , and so on .
0363###whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breacks down it is n't your responsibility .
0365###In conclusion , I think public transport has future , and the more people use it , the more future will have .
0366###I 'm your employee , to serve on your company .
0367###Very pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
0368###But pay a little low .
0369###I completed many tasks , including tutoring three students complete summer homework , correcting homework diligently assist the instructor , the instructor helped organize handouts , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very hard , but I have nothing to complain about .
0370###I work hard for two months , pay a lot .
0371###Just your wage paid too much lower than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yuan more than the existing wage basis .
0373###I think about transport that the government has to help the public transport , for example bus , train , metro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
0374###Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situation , but it could be annoying for search parking and for cost of fuel , and also maintenance cost .
0376###Instead in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies it 's not convenient invest money , because fewer people would use it .
0377###Tom Sawyer was a boy that lived with his aunt Polly and she had to punish Tom because sometimes Tom did n't go to school .
0378###On Monday Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend Huck which they talk a lot and Tom exchanged a tick for his tooth .
0381###Tom was so sad because Becky did n't to talk with him so Tom went on a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks .
0382###When Tom saw his house he sneak into his house and saw he aunt Polly crying for him .
0383###So the next day the people of the town went to church to hear the funeral of Tom because many people thought that Tom was dead but suddenly Tom open the door and got in so everybody was so surprised to see Tom .
0384###The next day Huck went to Tom 's house to tell him that there is an abandoned house up the hill so the two boys considered like an andventure .
0386###the two boys heard that he was planing to steal some money and kill people so the boys start their adventure on stoping Injuin Joe ...
0391###That is because you will improve your Japanese skill in them .
0392###Recently , many south East Asians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
0393###By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
0395###He was at Sarah 's house when suddenly he left all the bathroom dirty and went to his house .
0396###so he went back to Sarah 's house and clean all the bathroom , but Sarah already knew that he left the bathroom like this so before Michael entered to the bathroon she said : " I know what you leave there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .
0399###My school has a unique reputation for their friendliness and the quality of education .
0400###I like my maths teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understanad .
0402###This is an esay about my favourite sport , it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone , I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
0403###I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar teams sports , and always I go alone it is n't boring for me furthermore , I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven't wait anybody .
0404###I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had been operated on her back and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spendt a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hais , I hated that !
0405###Luckily the operation was fine and she left to come with me , and since that day I go for my own .
0406###Swim is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and I do n't like so much because they like disturbing me but sometimes it is amusing too .
0407###I would recommended to people who not know swim to learn , because I am pretty sure that it like it and later they can stop swim .
0408###I think that dance is a way for self - expression .
0409###It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
0410###Dance is a passion , a type of life .
0411###When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupids companions that they do n't understand anything .
0413###When you dance , sing , or act you are showing something to the public , something that 's important por you .
0416###You 'll wake up early for going dance , or do dance classes .
0417###You do n't matter if you go to sleep late , or do n't sleep ...
0418###That 's a joke , you must sleep .

0429###Hi mrs .
0432###For work in our cafe you have to speak English of course , maybe know how to cook some type of sweet foods like cupcakes , cake , cokiees or brownies , the most popular foods of this year .
0433###Another thing that you must know it 's how to deal with people , we are searching for someone who can impress everyone , also someone who can bring the customers good atencion and service .
0434###We need someone ready for work long hours , because our cafe is going to open every day .
0438###we think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will be dissappearing , after that we will be having wars .
0439###In 30 years we will have changed our anatomy , also we will be eating fast food , on the other hand , the north pole will have melted totally .
0440###The temperature will have become crazy by global warming , so some people will have died because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
0441###The Technology will have advanced and maybe the cars will be flying by streets and computers will have totally changed .
0444###I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
0449###You have to remember , that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
0450###They just have to calm talk about it .
0453###Good day ,
0454###My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 , the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows :
0455###1- make me fit and healthy
0456###2- classy game no friction between players
0458###Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits .
0459###However , the adults they can practise it as well and they will get the same .
0460###As citizens of village , we totally care about environment of our village .
0461###Every sunday , we do a mutual cooporation where anyone can treat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
0462###We clean the dirty ditch , sweep rubbish then we bury rubbish .
0463###Whilst , we recyling inorganic rubbish too .
0464###From inorganic , we can make bag , hat and other stuffs .
0465###Then they can sell them and get income of it .
0466###The creator of the haven and the earth , the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun .
0467###What we belief as Muslims that , we have created by one who do n't have other with him the one who create our father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Eve ) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. who they worship the same one ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell . so because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .
0468###Transportation is the heart of any city whether it is public or private .
0469###Nowadays people prefer own vehicles rather than
0470###public transportation . day by day folk are more crazy about own vehicles which leads dark future of public transportation
0471###firstly . i agree with given statement that there would be tough time for public transportation in near future.because people wamnts privacy as well as freedom which is quite impossible in public transportation .
0472###secondly these mode of transportation covers
0473###as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable
0474###to competition with public transportation .
0475###nowadays people have numerous option fro travelling like many private company
0476###which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire , privacy , freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile .
0477###I go for a walk to a park every day with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
0478###I met many people in the park .
0479###I never thought about , people got so many pet .
0480###In the peak time in the park is very busy even thought the park is huge !
0481###Some people are very friendly the same as their dog .
0483###Family is the most important institution of social life .
0484###Every member have his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , have to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
0485###Usually there are generation problems , sons do n't understand parents and vicecersa , but dialoging and listening emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
0486###Parents must give rules to sons to underline limits in social behaviour but also must listen others point of views to ri - arrange and update his knowledge .
0487###A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone give his contribute in family duties .
0488###Recently I saw the thriller of mokingjay part 2 .
0489###If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
0491###A lot of action , drama and romance .
0492###The fans of this series , had been wanting for this movie science the the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
0493###I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because is hard for little kids to understand , in opinion I think is more a teen movie .
0494###I think people will like this movie because , its very similar to the story of the book ; this one of the first movie that is really based in the book , the theme is very unique and original , also the actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will put double effort .
0496###It will be very cool to see the las part mokingjay !
0499###When I 've had a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
0500###Training Karate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your tiring routine .
0504###for someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
0507###Nowadays we use technology in every thing , from educations to making clothes , we use technology everyday and everywhere .
0508###Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
0510###but there was a fees in order to join the competition , he had no money . fortunately he have a lot of friends they can lent him .
0512###he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office , he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled , he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
0513###Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contamination in our planet .
0514###Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chair for me .
0515###On the other hand , in the future maybe would have a bus which having chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
0516###Other transport public is the taxi like car , it is so more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
0517###The AVE or aeroplane are a good option for long trip .
0518###In conclusion , in the future should have a bus so more comfortable .
0521###Dear sir Dimara .
0524###in my city all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and writing .
0525###The vandalisme in patras has increased a lot .
0526###Unfortunately when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls but they do not hear us .
0527###For our city it is very bad because when some new people visit Patras they see that thing .
0528###Patras is a very beautiful city and for her culture , and for her monuments .
0529###Why to see that abaser thing ?
0530###After we have this beautiful city we have to maintain her .
0531###In my opinion the police should stop the Vandalisme .
0532###If it have police all around the city nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to write something or to draw .
0534###Yours faithfully ,
0535###Jessyka stavros .
0536###All around the world pupils are waiting for finishing school .
0539###As a rule after last exams they do n't know what university to choose .
0540###What they will do in future they see , like in a fogg .
0541###In this way , idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
0543###Ten or eleven years at school make them tired , in spite of pupils do n't notice it .
0544###But choosing the second education is very important step , which need serious attitude .
0545###Secondly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional sphears .
0546###Also they would have an opprtunity being involved in volontier activity .
0548###This year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and gettin new power for future education .
0551###I live in San Miguel Almoloyan , this is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the State of Mexico , the care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the care of this .
0552###People collects trash of their house and await the trash truck that carried the trash to a landfill located outside the village .
0553###Also , people go out to collect the trash that there is on the kiosk , the church or in the principal places on the village .
0556###Firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts , and if it is possible the date exactly , because I need to book my flights .
0557###Secondly , I do n't live in Cork , so it would be grateful if you could send me details of accommodation that you offer in this course .
0558###And also , can you give me an idea of how much it would be cost every different options ? .
0559###It would be useful if I can live with other students , because it is a good way to learning a language as well .
0560###Lastly , Let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .
0564###Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening conversations of his new neighbours .
0565###They are planning to rob a very precious thing from Museum tonight .
0566###He does n't have much time to prove their plan and he could not wait to let it happen .
0569###Police reached Museum and caught robbers red handed .
0570###I am beleving that there is no future for the public transpot , using trains is mor convient and low expenses also to decrease the carpon gases which affecting the ozone , people should be aware about the effect of using the public transpotation on the econmics and enviroment , goverements shall encarge the people to use the other ways for transport , this subject shall be issuesd in all media to learn and encrage the people to use he wrigth way for transpot .
0575###I stayed about one week in the home my boyfriend .
0576###I had a wedding .
0578###One day , I visited Meandro del melero .
0581###The other day , I walked a lot and the end the way , we found a waterfall .
0584###The wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
0585###The wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people .
0587###You should visit Las Hurdes , It is a beautiful site .
0588###And there are a lot of things .
0591###In China , English is took to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
0593###They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day .
0595###That 's a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays .
0596###In addition to , some people think English is superior than Chinese .
0597###In me opinion , though English is for great significance , but English is after all a foreign language .
0599###English do help us read English original works , but Chinese helps us learn a true China .
0600###Only by characters Chinese literature can send off its brilliance .
0601###Learning a country 's culture , especial its classic culture , the first thing is learn its language .
0602###Because of we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our owne culture through a foreign language ?
0603###I was , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .
0605###Woolypools is a speciallist of meal , it 's a meal restaurant .
0606###In my opinion the restaurant can be better , respect to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
0607###I have expects to be more famous , better and biggest .
0608###The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is far from the people and cities , and the space , that is very small for lots of people .
0609###In this life we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
0611###Once , I got sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
0612###It was my favorite flower I have it ever .
0613###In my town we create a small organization for more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be attractive . the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it .
0615###is horrible have a person behind you all the time , you not have a life , not peace , not a happy .
0616###In adition all pearsons have the right to privacy and to be free .
0617###Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they eaten , drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whoever stay , if stay with something important our what buy .
0618###This is terrible , you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame , because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored .
0619###So that , politicians and film stars will have support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have the reward with what they earn .
0623###come here .
0625###Get in to the room .
0626###Get in to the bus .
0633###Let me watch your house .
0634###Let me allow to enter in to your cabin .
0635###Forgive me . :
0637###bring glass of water .
0641###stop shouting . do n't shout .
0642###Let us bath .
0643###Once upon a time was one little ant called Penny , he was really small in compared with the others .
0644###He hated to be like that because most of the ants made fun of him until one day something horrible and inevitable happen .
0645###It was a dark night it was raining until a big active volcano explosion buried them into the underground .
0646###All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one ca n't find one ... They started to get panicked !
0647###People just started to evacuated rapidly until it began a big earthquake ...
0648###Penny was too sad , the only thing that he can do is to wait and keep calm .
0649###Until the dawn all of them go out , so they sacred until they find a refuge .
0650###Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one find something .
0651###Like they were very religious ants they prey for her sacred ancestors so they can help them in the big deal .
0652###Something that they don know was that the whole thing was a movie !
0655###One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen , the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge .
0657###The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them , but they ca n't find them ...
0658###In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs , making them to leave the place .
0659###The ants win the war and they expand their habitat to the studio .
0660###No one attack them again and they live happily ever after !
0662###One of them I 'm keen on playing basketball the best . I always spend more time on playing it .
0663###I usually play basketball everyday around at least thirty minutes per day .
0665###One thing makes sure that I already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
0666###Basketball has many benefits not to me but also everyone .
0667###It makes me feel relaxed and unwind .
0669###I really cra
0671###When I have spare time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball match on television .
0673###Sometimes , I play it near sports centre .
0674###I go back home and have a sleep deeply when I finished it .
0675###basketball is an outdoor activity .
0677###With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population , many agricultueal land , forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks .
0678###From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human and animals .
0679###To start with , there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon .
0680###Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
0681###Additionally , people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need , which will distory the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species .
0682###According to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all , reducing building constructure from now on , planting more trees instead .
0683###Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
0684###To sum up , this unpleasant phenmenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before thing get worse ang the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
0685###Nowadays the languages are very important , and more English .
0686###This is not my first time that I study English .
0687###I have been studying English since I was child and I never speak and learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
0689###The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it produce much pollution , however the public transport is better to do a journey .
0691###Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram etc.these options it 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people .
0692###this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health
0693###I want to say something about the learning of the English Languaje , is hard to get to me for the next reasons :
0694###First reason ; the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like the Spanish Languaje , my native Languaje .
0695###That I want to say , is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje .
0696###Second reason . in the English syntaxis , the structure for construction paragraph or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but no always , Which is the rule ?
0697###Is there anyone ?
0701###My favourite team is India because I belongs to this country .
0703###In 1993 , Indian cricket team won his first world cup and that 's change the direction of air in favour of cricket and everyone start to follow this game .
0704###I love this game because my favourite sport man belong to this game .
0705###His name is Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulakar know as little master .
0706###Whenever I play this game , I always follow this person .
0708###Not only me but also every Indian always follow Sachin for cricket .
0710###He is the first player who played 200 test in cricket .
0711###He has many achievement like first 200 in one day etc .
0712###I love the way he was played .
0713###For a nuance first they have to decide what they con do better , batting or bowling .
0714###If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running , action , stance and for batsmen need concentration on lag and bat coordination , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which became key factor in batting .
0715###Also watch videos of some best player like Sachin , Rahul , Sir Don breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaram , Brett Lee etc .
0716###As health is important factor in every sport so also need to improve health , stamina .
0718###It 's glad to hear you are going to visit to my country .
0720###I can give you any advice on traveling and working in my country .
0721###l wish you will have a impressed time .
0723###If you want to travel this city . I can be your guide as I have a year free before university too .
0726###There are many local foods very popular .
0729###when you have played enough in this city , and you want to find a job here .
0730###I can recommed you to my uncle 's company to do a job .
0732###It may take very long time to find a job and you have not much time here .
0733###You may consider my advice .
0736###Also I think swim can keep our body fit and it can make the people who swim feel cool when it is in a hot day .
0737###The advice that I give to someone who want to start swimming .
0738###It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swim and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little .
0740###Dear Camp director ,
0741###My name is Eider and I am 21 years old . I had read your advertisement in the newspaper !
0744###Neither I have problems for working in a kitchen , will be clear if I told you that my parents have a bar .
0745###According to my age , evening activities are not a problem for me , and I played many sports during my life , such as socker , bolleyball , ...
0746###Waiting for your answer , Eider
0751###Thus helping to protect our environment to make it clean , safe , in order to not jeopardize our various diseases .
0752###In my village there are trash cans , so that no one threw debris on the ground .
0753###There are spcejalne place where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all garbage .
0755###Recently , also on the roof of the primary school were set the batteries and the whole school uses solar energy instead of electricity .
0756###They organize monthly meetings on the environment , residents participate in them .
0757###Wszysycy residents of my village , they try to , so that our village was clear that pollute the environment as little as possible .
0758###Travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride in public transportation.there are several reason to consider .
0759###Firstly , the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel .
0760###Secondly , the public vehicle route are more far than usual route .
0761###Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privacy .
0762###Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker .
0763###However , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action .
0764###Like watching outside or sight seeing , to mingle and meet different people .
0765###In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known .
0766###To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient .
0767###Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger .
0768###As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction .
0770###To begin with , extract the mineral will be harmful to our environment .
0773###However , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
0774###Next to go will be , the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely leads to air pollution .
0775###There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral .
0776###No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important thing which should be prevented .
0777###Last but not the least , the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence , especially , to our offspring .
0779###After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
0780###In addition , she has no blithe memory in her childhood .
0781###One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us .
0782###Due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .
0784###Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
0785###In addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
0786###In a nutshell , Based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extract the valuable mineral are outweigh the advantage .
0788###Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of poo .
0790###Global warming is a serious issue , higher temperatures make the ice caps melt .
0791###The longer we burry our heads in sand , the warmer the Earth will be .
0793###I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .
0794###Even if it will have happened there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too exspensive , not only for buying but for fuel , service and so forth .

0823###Contemporary Art is a very controversial issue nowadays .
0825###It is well known that many Art curators and Artists believes that Contemporary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based in their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the times this is unintelligible .
0826###Luckily the most expensive art still being the old , like Picasso or Freud .
0827###Nowadays a lot of empty art pieces are being sold at auctions around the world , for extraordinary high prices .
0829###Humanity has reached a level of differences that it would be not possible to stop .
0832###The sports days were held on Kwai Chung Sports Ground in 12th and 13 th November .
0835###I arrived the sports ground at 7:40 a.m. This year I 've join the 100-metre race .

0838###After that , the sports day began formally .
0839###At 10:45 a.m. , the girl 's grade C 100-metre race started .
0842###So I know that there was someone whose name pronounce same as me .
0843###Near the race , I was very nervous .
0844###When I was running , I heard my housemates cheering and the wind passing my face .
0845###That feel was very comfortable and made me felt relax .
0846###At last , I got number 10 out of 27 people .

0860###We should used of public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harming the environment and the world .
0861###It is the best that all people go to the place walking o running on the other hand it is more healthy .
0862###There is nothing wrong with it go to the place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper but no always .
0864###Is is commonly - debated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspects of one country , but of the whole world along .
0867###Alongside with its development , the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
0868###The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
0870###There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism .
0871###If tourism influences the econmy , it thereby influnces the environment , and if it influences the environment it influences the transport . How?people become more careful at their historcal sites , this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
0872###At a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently .
0873###At a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : on land , on sea or air .
0874###Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations .
0875###One upon a time there was a tiger who lives in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 daughters .
0876###The tiger was the mom names Amanda of 25 years old , the herders kill her parents , because the herders were poor and do n't have enough food to survive , so they kill them .
0877###The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion names John of 27 years old , his dad die because in a conflict with other animals , he got an infection .
0878###Her mom die because some things or someone drag her of the leg and drop it in a cave were other animals eat her .
0879###They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them .
0880###The 3 daughters where so different each other .
0881###The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots .
0883###The second daughter names Elizabeth is a leopard is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
0884###Had 12 years old .
0885###Another animals give them rewards or bonus because she discover that water was liquid .
0886###The last daughter was Ana who was the youngest of the family is a jaguar .
0887###She stay sleeping in the bed and doing nothing all day .
0888###Their parents were angry because she was the only one that never work .

0891###Hello friend ,
0892###I know you are searching for a flat to live for the whole next year .
0893###Maybe I found something for you : when I were on the bus returning to home I read a journal with some advertisements .
0895###There are a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a bathroom with shower but without bath and a cool living - room .
0896###I think that you have to bring with you winter clothes because here there is a really cold weather !
0902###You have classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free times you could still play piano without going to the classes .
0903###This is my opinion but the decision is yours , so when you decide it please send me a letter telling me about it .
0905###Hey my name is Joe and i 'm 21 years old and i'l think i'l would compliment the summer camp very good , because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak .
0906###My current job is to be a nurse at the local hospital and i'l can do everything as a doctor can .
0907###So if the kids is going to hurt themselves , then i'l can fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and smaller injuries .
0911###Then I revise Maths as at home , before to go at school , as at school , before to begin the exam .
0912###When I started to read the tracks I fell agitated and I thought that I was n't able to finish and pass that test .
0913###But when I finished before the time I was happy and relaxed .
0914###I always said that I passed that test and I was sure of that .
0915###And this is true .
0919###Congratulations your sister for your prize .
0920###I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind If I 'd have a posibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
0923###At the beginn I went to the childgarden and they taught me skiing .
0925###At twelve o'clock in the daytime my parents took me with them and we drove together .
0926###My father took me between his knies , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
0927###When I was older , I could get better my dream was:"SNOWBOARDING " , but I should learn skiiing perfectly like my parents .
0929###I had my first snowboardlesson und I loved it .
0930###I took every free minute to drive snowboard .
0931###That was the story why I go snowboarding .
0932###I enjoy snowoarding , because you feel free when you are driving down the piste .
0937###That 's why I like the winter more than the summer .
0938###Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who want to come to other thoughts .
0939###Although you are all the time in the nature and when you have luck you can see animals .
0949###She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
0951###The problem is the last thing she remember is that she has been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
0952###She fell sleep again , didn't she ?
0954###If she was n't awake , why she could n't remember anything after that ?
0955###This situation it was really fustrating not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
0957###She knows her way even in the dark ; she had gone to this spot a lot of time , specially the last few weeks .
0959###In case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud , train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time .
0960###Although compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these option .
0961###However , if I have given option to choose between all of three , I will say plane .
0963###First reason is its speed , compare to both other means of transportation it can travel faster .
0966###Second is safety , compared to other the chances of accident is less .
0968###Third one is comfort level .
0969###Plan is much more more comfortable than both train and boat .
0970###In conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of three means of transportation .
0971###The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that make plan as my first choice .
0972###Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to earn money or travel , it would be the best award for a student who attended the high school .
0973###The young people want to discover the world and travelling to reach places which would be unreachable otherwise
0974###I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
0977###There are a lot of people in the beach .
0978###The water was very cold and I could n't swim , then I played football in the sand of the beach .
0979###I took the sun a very long time and then I go to a cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
0981###No future for a public transpotr ? is this claim or no ?
0982###will we see on our roads the public transport afer 5 or eve 10 years yet ? that is really so interesting question/
0983###i think that it all depands from the development .
0985###yes , i agree , if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car , couse firstly you;ll spend less time , you travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time , as you need .
0986###but if we are talking abot travelling across you city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
0987###i think that this is the guestion for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another people .
0988###so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers
0991###My name is Mohamed and I am 28 years old male from the kingdom of Bahrain .
0992###I go to GYM and run on a daily basis to keep in shape and good health .

1002###Volleyball in one of the most difficult sports in the world , you should put your body in the correct form to throw the ball to the other side in the game .
1003###I been twelve years practice volleyball and because of it I knew lot of people who help me to grow up in the sport and life .
1005###Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world , in which I can be free and happy , apart of this , when I am bad , this is a distration of the university .
1006###You should try practice its so funny , but I advertise you , is not easy at first , but you hace to intent many times like you should do in life .
1007###In weekdays , I get off from my bed at 7 in the morning to go to my work which startst at 9 AM .
1011###However I sometimes do a skipping to fit myself .
1012###Michael wake up at the morning and he read the newspaper .
1013###He read in the newspaper an interesting noticie .
1014###The noticie was about a competition .
1015###The competition is about write stories .
1016###Michael was excited because he is great writer and he decided to compete .
1019###The story was very good but Michae did not know how to end the story .
1021###Michael sent the story but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake , he did n't put his name and address .
1022###Yes , i think TV can entertain and educate , because there are many comedy .
1023###Also there are a lots of educate channels .
1027###Different experts had talked about this question and there are so several opinions .
1028###People like to have the freedom for moving comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
1029###Public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only may use the transport in the moment that the timetable let you .
1030###For this way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because they want to move themselves when they need .
1032###Finally , in the future , the commodity of people maybe is going to determinate the most use of the cars than the public transport .
1034###Her skin is colored red and green , red dots ontop of the green to be more precise .
1037###His skin is colored red , just like the father .
1038###Dear Paul !
1039###I haven't written you for ages but I was very busy because of the exams at the University .
1040###What about you?What 's new in Brazil?As you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization at the concert , which was performed last month .
1041###So I was there something like staff .
1044###When the concert finished , we went to cloakroom to get signatures from musicians .
1045###I felt like a star!Crowded of people were waiting in front of the cloakroom for the signatures , but only me and my sweety girlfriend got them .
1046###People were so envious ... I liked it!It was fantastic experience .
1047###Next time I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well . You will earn nice money and you have cultural experience .
1052###There are adds in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
1053###In spite of this range of media , the TV continues being the most important means of communication .
1054###A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but , is like that ?
1055###On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , has a lot of mentions to products or services .
1057###There are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to report to people .
1058###The TV is the most accesible way of communication and people can see the messagen on this way .
1059###In addition , behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
1060###In one add there are , for example , the publicist 's work , the companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
1061###To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
1063###Why am I making this choice you clearly can ask , I love sun and good weather .
1064###Yes it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near the sun because you finish t be burn by the sun .
1065###In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things life gives us and have fun with them .
1066###During summer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or run inside the water of the sea !
1067###I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the warmness of summer .
1070###The wonderful colours of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous .
1072###I saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising .
1073###I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment , that 's why I need to work in order to pay my fee .
1074###I have some experience working with children from all ages , besides I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly .
1075###Also I 've just got my FCE certificate this year but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native country .
1076###I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and above all patient , therefore I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily at any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people and a different culture .
1082###It was really importatnt for him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he haven't got any achievements .
1084###He invited all his friends from team and made a party .
1087###She was dreaming about being his wife .
1091###He was waiting 2 hours for her .
1093###That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
1096###But time 's up .
1098###Mel looked sadly at Tom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of his home .
1099###He followed and apoligized her .
1105###No ! He has never acted like this .
1107###He decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Mel .
1108###One day Mel was feeling really bad so Tom took her to the hospital .
1111###Mel has lost the baby .
1115###He has broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
1119###Even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
1120###The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weigh , able to do a lot of movement that are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
1122###I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
1123###If you are not a good swimmer , you lose the big part of pleasure of enjoying the water , both in the sea or in pool .
1124###Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
1125###I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because is fairly simple and it can gives a lot of satisfactions !
1126###Your efforts will be prized by succeeding , and you can obtain it with practice .
1129###·Activities to kill time
1130###As our town is well - known for our magnificul beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beah or canoening and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Canal .
1133###·Others ideas to have fun
1134###In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library group , theatre ...
1135###As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
1137###So , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .
1138###If you tried all the activities , you would spend a great time here , in Castelldefels !
1143###You will come to the Reus airport , right ? .
1144###Well , the airport is located just outside Reus , it 's small but it has a lot of servicies and transport .
1146###The bus stops at the Salou bus station .
1150###Moreover I send you a map in order to locate the street .
1153###I 'd like to visit museums , monuments and going to clubbing with you .
1159###I am Engineer of Execution in Mines , entitled in the " Instituto Profesional Virginio Gómez " .
1160###I am particularly interested and I am competent to apply for the post of Chief of operations at the new underground project Chiquicamata .
1162###On the other hand , I have the theoretical knowledge to use new the technologies this great project requires .
1163###I am also able to lead the operations of the project responsibly and through a team work to achieve the objective and to continue with the prestige that your company has .
1164###My work experience is very outstanding due to I had the privilege of belonging to the " Minera El Teniente " as shift manager , Chief of operations at " Minera Andina " and at the evaluation department of CODELCO projects .
1166###It would be a pleasure to discuss personally why I am qualified for this position .
1167###I expect a prompt response of the Company .
1168###Without further ado , I remain yours .
1170###Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign language , for me is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
1171###Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
1174###Today globalization is bringing the world more close , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
1175###On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspect , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

1200###Given is a diagram introducing the procedures of making bank notes .
1201###Desgin the bank notes are the first and indispensable step .
1202###Peple should decide the background colour and thw artwork while they have to consider the security issues .
1203###Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
1204###The third section is to print the prepared bank notes .
1205###Usually there will be 50 ban notes per sheet .
1206###The colour will print on the both sides and every notes has their unique ink also the images will be slightly raised .
1207###After that , it comes to the most significant stage , that is inspect the quality of the printed sheets .
1209###As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes .
1211###In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .
1212###Eventhough it seems to be easy to make them , but every steps needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .
1215###Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and happinness of people .
1216###He started to think how he could get better our lives and he found a solution .
1218###While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned the oldest people from de village about the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places making a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
1220###Local authorities helped this initiative creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
1222###As a result of this attitude , since Alfred had this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .
1223###People now is worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet , Green Planet is called .
1228###For your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have a high team work skill .
1229###We also value that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology , and hosting management .
1230###However it 's possible that we do n't find enough people with that profile so , we could accept people with one year of experience .

1240###You probably wo n't believe me but I met all members of Dżem band , I talked to them and we had lunch together , they 're very nice men . Because of helping them I had the best place during the concert and I have their authographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
1241###In general I had only one duty that is checking quest list , above that I had to help in cleaning area after the concert .
1244###I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .
1248###The aim of this report is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your branch in Madrid last month .

1251###They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
1253###Second , the teachers were really good skills to teach .
1255###This way we made the most of us and never gave up improving our English level .
1256###Third , phonetic classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
1258###However , in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's team .
1259###This way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .
1260###To wrap up the report just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .
1261###Yours sincerely ,
1263###I am keen on cinema thus I love to watch all types of fims .
1266###I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
1267###In addition , I think that the settings are very reallistic and the actors had a great performance .
1271###I am 20 years old , living in Port - Said , Egypt .
1275###I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes .
1277###I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member in World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
1279###Last two years , I worked in many places such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and the water purification company .
1280###I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our life so I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
1282###When I work anything I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
1283###One of my goals in the life is to invent an effective drug for one the incurable like cancer , AIDS and hepatitis .
1284###I asked myself many times what is the aim of our life ?
1285###And what are the benefits of work and study ?
1286###But if you see your world and realize it well , it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
1287###I learnt from Research that you can do everything in anytime in addition a little tired can change the life for the better .
1288###I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travelling to all the countries in the world also , I attended a lot of conferences in my field so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for the community services and development my society as I hope to come back and teach others what I learn .
1289###I am writing with reference to the post of job as a camp monitor that you require in summer .
1290###I have seen your advert this morning and I am really interested in it .
1291###Although I am a young girl , I think I am a quialified person for the post .
1292###I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after chilren from 3 to twelve yeras old . I consired myself quite patient and fun that in my opinion , they are two qualities highly necessary for this kind of job .
1293###I am good too at working in a team .
1294###I do not like to be or feel alone , this could be one of my great weakness .
1304###Although privately oned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
1306###Carbon based fuels will not last forever .
1307###I would say that most probably private care are not " sustainables " in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .
1308###The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a staggering 3 billions human beings .
1309###I know that it is nice to dream a future of technological people flying around , each of them with its own private small helicopter .
1311###I guess that in our future there are no helicopters , and not even cars .
1313###he price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
1314###I reckon that that will change the habits of the public .
1316###Imagine this picture : the first class of this semester , students are yawning and do not pay attention on the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester .
1317###Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying .
1318###Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
1319###More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .
1320###To begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time .
1321###For example , on history class , history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North America before he start to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester .
1322###It is very wasting time and not efficient .
1323###Next to go would be , students get used to relax by having no study and homework in the long vacation .
1324###For example , when the semester start , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
1327###For instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
1328###In a nutshell , based on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
1333###I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems .
1334###I like to speak with my team partners .
1336###when I play bad I feel nervous but my parters give me their unconditional support .
1338###I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
1339###So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really like it .
1340###if you do n't like it there are many options to practise whatever sports .
1341###The soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
1342###In this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
1347###On september 12th,2014 I went to New York city .
1348###In the fly I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
1349###The flight was approximatly five hours where I watch beautiful movies .
1351###We went to long island because there he lives .
1352###He have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin " Angel " who looks just like me .
1353###In New York I eat so much , I also went to the city thay never sleeps , Manhattan .
1356###Finally we arrived to Niagara Falls city that looks like a ghost place .
1357###It does not have too much to do but there were the falls .
1359###They were incredible amazing and beautiful .
1360###I take too much photos because you do nt visit places like that everyday .
1362###My uncle Juan lives in United States of America and I was very to hug him because I miss him a lot .
1363###My cousin Angel was very happy to see me and me too , we are like siblings .
1364###My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she say they do not see me frecuently and many other part of my family .
1365###In conclusion I have a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visit awesome places as Niagara Falls and Time Square , recieving a lot of presents and soecially eat a lot delicious food .
1366###Most attending students to Universities are out of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
1367###Most universities provide cheap accommodations such as , shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have low income .
1368###Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
1369###Sharing houses or rooms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . saving money and time will be more Obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
1370###In spite all these benefits , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
1371###Many years ago , I shared a friend in a room for few months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst during my life , he was dirty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . living alone will grant me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceed the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .
1372###they annoying me
1373###Although The federal government which is decided as a role of USA has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
1374###The powerful of the federalism which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .
1375###An example of that is the marriage of homosexual where some state admit this marriage , others do n't .
1376###Also , the reading passage declares that even the federal government let each state function independently , it still control on the main decisions .
1377###this case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert .
1378###also the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the state and the federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states
1379###In conclusion , federal government which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .
1381###I think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their frustrating moments .
1382###In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about spicy savor .
1383###People say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip : arrived , get away to the frustration of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arrived home triumphal .
1384###In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the traveler find a manner to get alone with his or her companion .
1385###This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city .
1386###As an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interest such as museums or malls .
1387###Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enjoy for Mexican food .
1388###Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country .
1389###For example , there are a lot of American people that does n't like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .
1390###As advice I would suggest you to ask for sauces with lower pepper .
1391###In this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .
1392###In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors that coming to my country : Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
1393###After the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August 29th 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced for face to face communication .
1394###SMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds .
1396###However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
1397###This essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potential future of these implications .
1399###The benefit of being from being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
1401###Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
1402###That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
1404###Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .
1407###For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .
1408###However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone .
1409###However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
1410###However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
1412###In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment .
1414###For example , after the premier of The Hunger Game was released , a fan posted an onset racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Black person ( Rauch and Schanz , 2013 ) .
1415###Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involve with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
1416###For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a case of continuous disturbing a woman from a man called Mr .
1417###X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
1419###Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances .
1420###Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .
1421###The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communicate skills that they have .
1422###In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
1424###However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .
1425###In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
1427###In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
1428###Possibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .
1433###Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travels , special ocassions , etc .
1435###This practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
1436###However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as learning to draw .
1437###Both skills are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
1439###Recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations lifes(teenagers and kids ) .
1445###The first spring birds came back from the warm countries .
1446###They are singing funny and building their nests .
1449###We set our clock forward one hour in March .
1450###The summertime was first introduced in England in 1908 .
1452###We usually set our clock back an hour in October .
1457###You think that your life style will improve ?
1458###Well you are mistaken .
1459###For doing different kind of sports you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
1460###What if you do n't have none of those requierments ?
1461###Then you know hockey is the aswner .
1463###It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
1464###it 's a team sport .
1468###Through all my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a life style to me .
1471###Hockey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seen it with other eyes .
1472###So stop searching for the right sport , this one is for you !
1473###As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport media for environmental care .
1474###In spite of some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose this ones and that 's because pollution is several issue that we have to deal with .
1475###The environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids too ancient people .
1476###The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social consume .
1477###If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live .
1479###I think the government will slow down the fee in public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global heating .
1480###In Coslada City Council , people are well informed about taking care environment .
1481###The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the waste .
1483###Each of them has three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .
1484###There have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .
1485###Nevertheness it is never enough , because dog 's owners that they have most of the blame .
1486###Since 2008 , there are many bike paths across the city , so the citizens will be able to avoid the car and they will emit less air pollution .
1488###The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
1490###A problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their target of making money without thinking of the effects .
1492###We usually use the public transport , which has a great quality in the city I live .
1493###It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is worth .
1494###We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are clasified according to the material we want to recycle .
1496###The benefits are given to several organizations which take of care of the environment .
1497###My sister teaches people what to do with things they want to rid of , such as bottles or papers .
1499###It shows that this kind of things can have a second life .
1501###The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
1502###All historians , researchers , scientists agree with this .
1504###Egypt is a kind of the river civilization among the huge desert Sahara .
1505###All over the time the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians .
1506###Furthermore , elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .
1507###The Egyptians called their country ' Black Land ' to mark it off of the red soil of desert .
1512###But such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive .
1513###The great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animals .
1515###But I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level .
1516###When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milano .
1520###It quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousand of tourists , who come every year .
1521###It was built in 79 A.C. by Tito , who was the Roman emperor .
1523###Moreover navy wars were represented in order to celebrate Roman army .
1525###In my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
1528###That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
1529###In this fast moving world transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
1530###Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
1534###Firstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all class of people in society .
1535###Variety of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
1536###Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
1538###Everybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and is convenient
1539###and sophisticated and can travel faster .
1540###To sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both has equal advantage and disadvantages .
1543###However , during the rush hour , there are always have such a ruin person who has no public awareness at all .
1544###They occupy too many seats , inclouding priority seats .
1546###They do n't respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
1547###Moreover , I think that provide the seat to elders is also a problem .
1548###Priority seats , are preserved to those who need , not only elders but also some adult need it .
1549###Somehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which lead to Some misunderstanding between them .
1550###Some people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .
1551###Moreover , some old people would take this considerative action for granted and they would even command young adults or students offer their seat without manners !
1552###In my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to criticize expect that .
1553###Everyone should develop the awareness of public manner .
1555###We depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films
1563###TV can help introduce youth to classic Hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .
1565###But television have also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .
1569###I deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - business .
1570###I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advise until the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after - sales in the aim of customer satisfaction
1571###I also worked with large and small teams in back - offices , managed many administrative activities related to mortages , personal loans , contability and investments too .
1572###I worked for several years to the acquisition of new customers , to provide them with a complete service , from the account to insurance products , investment products , personal loans , revolving credit , and cross - selling products .
1573###In many years of work I have honed my skills in managing non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
1574###non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
1575###I have faced several situations always work with serenity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic .
1576###I 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting other points of view together finding ways to deal .
1577###I work for the same large company for 25 years , now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
1578###Needs to work my husband has been living in Zaandam , I want to find a new job in Holland to rejoin our family .
1579###I like sports such as skiing , riding and swimming . I 've also got the rescue licence , I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the patent padi dive master
1580###Nowadays we all hope , that public transport can save the world .
1581###When we see all this cars in our yards , when we stay in traffic jam , we think that one day we will have to live our car and use public transport .
1582###If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the immortal traffic jam .
1583###But , probably , this situation is only period of development of transport .
1584###We are told about a lot of innovations in this spheare .
1586###Maybe , robots will be able to drive more smart then people .
1591###But another of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , that they are drivers at the moment .
1592###However , there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway .
1593###And people who hate public transport , there will always be .
1594###The question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
1599###there are few reasons whcih show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
1600###First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , it makes your trip more easy and comfortable .
1601###Second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in the intrenational level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value on your profile and you can get a higher salary .
1602###Third , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are also getting know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .
1603###Over these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happened around the world .
1605###Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greedy .
1607###High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
1609###All the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
1610###The higher temperature enhance , the worst the living quality is .
1611###If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living places , we must have a dark and hopeless future .
1613###Losing enough water supply , people 's body will become weak and rough .
1614###In this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fight , hatred and sadness .
1615###Everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightness .
1616###The terrible consequences , are caused by the humans ' unsatisfied heart .
1617###Friends , from now , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
1619###The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the really danger is if you get discovered .
1620###When people know that they were deceived , that they trust were broken , heads will roll .
1624###I did n't choose that , this job has chosen me .
1626###I would like to apply for the position of beach lifeguard assistance which I saw advertised .
1627###For the last two years I have joined the swimming group at the University .
1628###I managed to succeeded in many competitions in the country and abroad .
1630###On the other hand I completed the first aid course , in the Red Cross .
1632###Please do not hesitate to contact me if you should require further information .
1637###In our modern world , many people are suffered from stress that spring from life conditions .
1638###In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .
1639###Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people .
1640###In holidays , people can away from daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .
1642###For example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .
1644###People can review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful .
1645###For instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .
1647###The reason is that people must complate their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
1648###It can be clearly seen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings .
1649###For example , people meet their relatives that never see for a long time .
1651###They can pray for God and it gives a relief for people .
1652###When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material world .
1653###In holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that leads to stressful life .
1654###In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
1655###Also holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away modern life that has full of material subjects .
1657###However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .
1659###Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 emissions .
1660###Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
1661###On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .
1664###Getting wet when it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking when hot weather .
1665###In my point of view , Cycling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
1666###No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
1667###For example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
1668###And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedule .
1669###Also , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaps is not able not reach .
1670###When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distance .
1671###Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
1673###As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .
1674###Recently , several studies have shown evidences that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers .
1675###In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
1676###Second , public transport saves city spaces .
1677###As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded .
1678###Correspondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
1679###Provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congesting .
1681###The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
1682###For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relax .
1683###People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot at outside .
1684###Though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
1686###Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others .
1687###It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one .
1689###Should learn other languages ? .
1690###We live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .
1693###Also in recent years to express yourself in English , French , Germany and Russian has became something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
1695###Also I consider that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .
1696###It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .
1700###I had a part - time job as babby - sitter and I take care of my 11 years old brother very often .
1701###I worked in an Easter camp too and I have already prepared lot of ativities , like " rappel " , paintball ...
1702###That is for these reasons I think I have the skills for the job .
1704###I hope you considerate me for the job , rodrigo
1705###Today , I went to my Winnie 's home with Adriana in the afternoon .
1706###We ate delicious food and play interesting games altogether .
1708###At 2 o'clock in he afternoon , we arrived at Winnie 's home .
1709###First , we listened to some songs , such as almost and big big world .
1711###Winnie loves eating very much so I can easily find much food at her home .
1712###We had mouth- watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy .
1713###After having tea , we play hide - and - seek altogether in Winnie 's garden .
1716###Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
1718###Are you okay'I asked .
1719###I was shaking like a leaf and my heart is pounding since I was worried about Winnie .
1720###I had butterflies in my stomach.'Yes , I am fine , ' Winnie replied .
1724###I felt glad today although Winnie hurt herself .
1728###In my opinion the house in the future will be better .
1730###Inside will be full of conveniences .
1731###Big spaces will be divided in a few zones .
1732###Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen 's zones and so on .
1733###In house of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in every house .
1734###Television will be cordless , as this way as at present Internet .
1736###Thanks to that it can expand or reduced .
1740###Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
1741###It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children can start to learn swimming as early as two years of age .
1742###Swimming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
1743###Swimming as a sport is very useful in wieght reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your wieght , it is also the best sport for the asthmatic patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
1744###If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .
1746###I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antaya on October .
1747###I had a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert .
1749###In the concert time all people can enjoy but nobody think about how they are preparing to concert .
1751###For example they know everything about each helper 's jobs but on the same time they just concern own subjects .
1753###In the concert morning were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided do not think about the concert just do your job which would be given .
1754###When we were arranging concert plan we made work sharing for all of us .
1755###Some of them started design the stage , some of them checking songs volume and lights .
1756###My job was checking songs list which singers would perform .
1758###They were always wanted to change some songs which was on the list .
1759###On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
1760###Actually everybody can be worried because they gave time and effort for it .
1762###It is difficult to explain that feeling .
1763###When the concert finished I felt like a bird which flying freely .
1764###Of course I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing .
1766###I want to invite you to our next concert which will be next month if you have any time please come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
1770###Regarding advertisement , technology is having a huge , and not always possitive impact on outdoor advertisement .
1771###From black - and - white adds posted in public places we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in every available and imaginable spot .
1773###The recent developments in mobile technology allows advertisers to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
1774###I''m sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work the adds on the buses i will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of Mallorca , or an add from tripadvisor with Mallorca in it .
1775###It will suit me sometimes , and it even will be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggresive .
1777###Advertisement might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed on the wrong spot or showed at the wrong time they loose they artistic side .
1778###But , technology is hre for best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
1780###I 'd like to have a big detached house in sububs of Artem or Vladivostok .
1782###If I had this house , I would decorat it in modern stayl .
1783###I would build there fitness gym , wardrobe -room , swimming pool .
1784###If I had such house , I would like to equip a barbecue area in my garden .
1789###When I feel stressed off , I always play tennis to release my pressure .
1790###If you are a beginner of tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
1791###As the proverb goes : If you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right tools first to work on it .
1800###An explosion of channels arrived to our houses in the eighties .
1802###Number of Channels are gradually reducing
1803###In our country one decade ago when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
1804###All tv tried to get several licences to distribute their shows .
1805###In order to resolve some deficits budgets , today there are mainly two TV groups .
1806###Less channels means less choices .
1808###It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who watching this or that televison program .
1813###Big Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
1814###It is expensive to keep journalists and camera all around the world .
1819###Nowadays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
1824###to join your small group on a trip around the world .
1826###With several trips to many countries I have made until now , I would say that I have already some experience in travelling around the word .
1828###For ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learnt a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientate myself in the wilderness .
1833###Basically my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible , I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of your country as well .
1834###As I told you before I ca n't afford to pay this trip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me .
1836###Can you give me a hand on it ?
1838###It will be helpful if you find a small apartment near the Cambridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
1844###First of all , you should get outside of the airport terminal .
1845###There you will see bus stations in the street .
1846###When you get there take the bus which has number 111 .
1847###Then ride to the bus stop " Zličín " .
1849###If you choose this way , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where will we meet exactly .
1850###But if I were you I would take a taxi for the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
1852###Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time of year .
1853###That 's why you do n't have to take warm clothes .
1854###I am delighted to see you soon .
1857###In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
1859###Actually , students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food , for these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somowhere when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for mains course : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
1860###On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote this , because we will have a good night or not depending the type of atmosphere we choose .
1861###In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we had spoken about book , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
1863###I love the food here and I think my classmates too .
1864###You can it the best burgers you have ever eaten .
1868###I can not say how they are because you have to taste them .
1871###You will want to come another time .
1872###However , if you do not like burgers you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal .
1873###Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .
1874###More than a billion people use buses , taxi 's and trains etc as tourists , for work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .
1877###That is why because the cost of petrol , diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
1882###I disagree with the statement stated above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor .
1885###So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
1886###Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
1891###Firstly , reading helps to become a well Educated Person and give a chance to develop knowledge .
1892###That 's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
1895###You can imagine how heroes look Like , you can imagine different views , where the action takes place .
1896###And finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want .
1897###On the other hand , if you like being in company the best way for you is movies .
1898###Because you can watch it with your friends .
1901###but all these factors are not important for me .
1902###I suppose that books are better than them film version .
1903###To sum up , I 'd like to say reading is really great thing .
1905###She was with her mum ..
1909###Just like her ... ''Mum I love this doll!Could you bye it for me ? '' she said .
1910###Her mum could n't deny to her , so she bought it .
1911###Oh!The girl had so many special moments with her doll!!They looked so adorable together!They were like twins !
1913###She was eighteen years old , she had to be indepedent .
1914###So she took a deep breath and put her doll in the attic just like her childhood memories .
1916###She went there and thera was the doll with a knife in her hand.''Bell , why you do n't play with me anymore?Are you boring of me?Just because I have only one eye?But you removed me the other one .
1917###Just because I do n't have one if my gloves?But you did it again!''she screamed .
1919###Next day , going at her home her mum wanted to find her daughter .
1921###The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a sentence,''Why did you leave me that way ? ''
1926###Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can lose finally .
1928###You supposed to use your brain as well .
1930###As the other sports , tennis is getting more modern , fast and commercial .
1932###Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
1934###It is not fair enough .
1935###Children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps to physical health and so on .
1938###Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
1940###Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
1942###I ' m the perfect choice for this work , in fact , I 'm interested in different kinds of food because I am Italian , and for us food is everything .
1943###In Italy , I attend school for waiter and cook , and sometimes I cook lasagna , pasta , pizza and many other specialties of my country , and I was assumed in many famous restaurant .
1944###I"m also good at dealing with people , in fact since when I was younger , I have done the animator at the summer camp of Alpignano , the city where I lived , and I spent a lot of time with children and adults .
1945###I also worked for many theater companies and I am so good and kind when I talk with other people , also if I do n't know them .
1946###At the end , I 'm also prepared to work long hours , when I worked with my aunt in his cafe , I worked from eight a.m. and I lasted at 9 p.m. , it was difficult but I did it all days .
1952###It is true that going abroad can open new point of views about your own learning process .
1953###Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are doing .
1955###However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focus on your learning tasks .
1956###From my point of view I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages especially if you have some money saved for it .
1957###But if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
1958###You can even talk with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms online such as Skipe and others .
1960###When I was little I had tried a lot of sports , Handball , Swimming , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that I have never imagine : Football .
1961###All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I tried it , I loved it .
1963###At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who where all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to intergrate me when they play , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .
1964###Now , some women and I started to organize female matches , so I am more used to play with girls . I never imagine that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it takes part of my life .
1966###One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to reacive some punches .
1969###Its name is " The English oven " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
1970###The service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle .
1971###The interior is big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
1973###The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
1974###The've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
1977###They 've got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
1981###I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goes there .
1982###During whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accompanying them .
1983###In my view , public person deserve to have their own life , without photographing .
1984###In one hand , becoming a public person associate with jornalist , mass - media , flashes .
1985###Famous people are obligated to provide their life in exemplary way .
1986###However , they still being ordinary people , they make mistakes .
1987###People are thought being jealous .
1988###Notice any kind of failures .
1989###It seems to me that journalist might be absolutely toxic and they have defective infulence on society which assess celebrites through the prism of journalistic documentary .
1990###In the other hand many of stars sold their privacy to earn more and more money .
1991###The value of their talent , abilities are counted in amonut of tabloids scandals .
1992###Summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into the limelight their life .
1993###It has ever been very useful for a long time ago , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who ask if the public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .
1994###However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
1996###The cars need to be repaired ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
1999###If you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
2000###Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
2001###Besides in some cities , car can not be parked in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
2003###From my point of view , I get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country .
2006###Take an example of mobile technology , your latest handset , with latest configurations becomes outdated within few months after buying it .
2008###However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
2009###Last 50 years science and technology took great leaps , internet , mobiles made us more connected .
2010###Today , we have all the information at finger - tips .
2011###Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new place , Google maps are always there to help .
2012###We need not to cram English words today , as we can quickly find meaning of any word on our mobiles .
2013###Meeting new people or selling your products , you do nt need to face anyone , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .
2014###Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progress mankind has made in technology .
2015###On the other hand a number of terrorism , global warming and greed became top challenges of today 's world .
2016###Climate changes due to global warming causing natural disasters now and then .
2017###Terrorist activities causing havoc in public live .
2018###Corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people leaders .
2019###If these challenges are not addressed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .
2020###We need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hand it would be boon for us , in wrong hands it has power to destroy the world as we see it today .
2021###to who may concern ,
2023###I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " That 's for me , I 'm the right person for this kind of job ! " .
2024###Perhaps , you 're wondering why I should be the right person .
2025###That 's soon said .
2026###I 'm motivated , flexible and openminded person and I had a lot of experience in this field as well .
2030###I had a very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live them again .
2032###As you requested , I attach it in this mail .
2036###The same about my parents ; they are old and sometimes they call me for talk about their healht .
2037###Concerning video - games , I agree with scientits that they thought its help children 's brain to develop , but is important controller them because there are a lot violent games .
2040###It is very common to use the Internet in my work for research or google information and also connect whit other teachers , speak about courses and change information .
2043###In the time of joy and sorrow .
2044###Nothing is impossible in life but not doubt it is not easy to find sincere friends .
2045###It does not mean you will never find one .
2046###It is very important to interact and socialise with people to make a friend .
2047###The more people you will meet the more easy it will become for you to find a friend .
2048###When you find one spend time with them , share views , ideas and go out with them .
2049###Friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should share their views about it .
2051###You could find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
2053###readers are able to express their opinion freely .
2054###they use a quality English language which avoids slang language .
2055###As result , it is suitable for students who learn English Language to improve their English .
2057###For example , it is not suitable for children due to official Language . there were also a huge number of commercials advertisements which make the readers bored .
2059###Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smart and economy very highly developed .
2062###Sometimes then I am watching TV or I am reading newspaper I notice that gadgets become very useful for our life .It seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easily .
2063###Also it makes us more clever .
2064###I am convinced that using tablet computers in our everyday life is rather good .
2065###People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag .Pupil could not say that he left a book because he has all books in his tablet computers
2070###Personally for me , I like books very much .when I at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the paper of books .
2072###We should use it but we are must not forget about books .
2075###This day was full of joy and happiness , but something went wrong after when she told him that she is pregnant .
2077###At the moment when she told him that she is pregnant , he just frozen .
2079###He thought it 's easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .
2081###It was weird how many questions and doubts came up on his head .
2082###One part of him was really happy , because to be a father is his one of the biggest dream , but on the other hand he could n't handle this news .
2083###This woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
2087###He could n't handle the feeling , when she tried to touch him , to kiss and hug him .
2088###He knew that she loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
2089###Her voice , her smile and even her body was to wrong on this moment .
2090###She could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .
2091###And now , he just avoids her and he is not happy about the news .
2097###To the beginning I am going to take about what is my lovely sports and why I will enjoy the sport .
2098###In fact , I do not like to do some sports during the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .
2099###Firstly , I think , swimming pool is clearing .
2100###Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take shower .
2101###Secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like big sun and sand .
2102###Third , swimming in the ocean is most dangerous .
2104###Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
2105###Moreover , I think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax our bodies first . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .
2106###In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
2110###As a result , our water resources are difficult to be preserved and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational use of it .
2111###The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .
2113###Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need .
2114###In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .
2115###And that is the negative point , these dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .
2116###I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anyways this is n't important information .
2117###I searched my family in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .
2118###I get a bit scared so I search them outside in the streets .
2119###I did n't knew that a bomb hit on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .
2120###I think the reason why I did n't know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish were does the explosion hit .
2121###Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food , I was starving to death so I ate a lot .
2122###We made some incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow .
2123###I think that someone drags some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping .
2125###In the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us .
2126###In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises .
2128###I stomp him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
2129###We were talking about this when a dog just came near ; it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature .
2130###He bit my leg and it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others but it was too late , it was the group or us .
2132###In some ways that she robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival .
2133###But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
2134###DOING EXCERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOURE HEALTH

2140###Now days there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practice any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYM or practise Crossfit or something like that .
2141###Soccer it 's a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to controll the ball and dribble you 're rivals on the field .
2142###I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
2143###Thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .
2144###Is there any future to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
2145###Many disagree about the public transport whom are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling .
2148###Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .
2149###There is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
2150###On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain « - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...
2151###There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . »
2153###Indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
2156###» says a 17 - 22 years old boy .
2157###Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
2158###According to The Saigon Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .
2160###It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drank , it would not have as much accidents .
2161###Finally , many developed countries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam have been decreased .
2165###Do you agree or disagree " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
2166###Disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
2167###Even though being truthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
2168###Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer .
2169###It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
2170###To further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .
2171###For example , if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .
2172###People usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings .
2173###Instead of doing so , people may praise her with other things on her .
2174###In that case , they could still make conversions without boiling her mood .
2175###The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted .
2176###If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .
2177###If I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .
2178###These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .
2180###When we were in the class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .
2181###Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he made a mistake .
2182###Due to this , we're both called to meet the headmaster .
2183###I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
2185###My curiosity had put me into a big trouble .
2187###However , things do n't happened like what I hoped .
2188###I ended getting expelled from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I steal our classmate - Sally 's wallet .
2189###I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without given any chance for us to speak out .
2191###We wiped off our tears , and waved our hands when we left the school .
2192###Although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
2195###my name is Bianca Padovesi , and I have read your advertisement for the job .
2196###I consider I am the right person for this job because , firstly , I speak fluent and clear English which is very important to communicate .
2198###Furthermore , I am very creative and it is a good aspect of myself , as I can invent new and entertaining games for the kids to have a great time .
2199###I like making puzzles or games which imply running , jumping which are important for the kids development .
2200###I am not very good t cooking but because I never have time to dedicate time on that .
2201###I think that if I watch and learn how to do it I would learn very fast and can dominate it .
2202###That is a good quality of mine , I learn thing very fast and I also can get used to new thing .
2206###We were ready to go and find the others , we went outside the shelter we built and write in wall near to the shelter " safe zone " and if there is someone that needs supplies he would find some supplies and ammo to survive .
2207###We start our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pests on our way there were various guys that were sick we could n't do anything except for , keep going , I was seeing my little group to # diminish and some of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .
2208###I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help the entire world or just save a group the decision was in my hands it was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n't want to die . while I was thinking about that we found a body it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group one of those guys we wanted to find and alive not dead his face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .
2209###We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tells us what happened to everyone , the # battle against hunger started everyone was hungry and we haven't eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutritional based food where we could eat with no problem and be ok .
2210###We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .
2211###We got close to the pharmacy there was no walkers inside so we run into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
2212###In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .
2213###But private traffic in this town is yet more present , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the well known factory .
2215###When you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in any tobacco shops near to your home .
2216###If you like shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items of the main great factories of Europe and above .
2217###Like all the industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .
2218###At the end , the taxi are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .
2219###There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
2220###To my mind there should be a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .
2221###In my opinion big stars should be able to relax and take some private time .
2222###As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
2223###Unfortunately , this is a part of celeb 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .
2224###But on the other hand , there should be some inviolability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
2225###This rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
2226###I know that catching celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shocking news for people who read tabloids .
2227###To my mind , they do not believe celebs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in theirs bank accounts
2228###So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a privte life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .
2230###I recently watched this new film based on one of the books of this worldwide known author .
2232###The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film .
2233###The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .
2235###However , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
2236###The people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze .
2237###He took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place .
2238###Still , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .
2241###I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .
2242###I love the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .
2244###I am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , pass and set better , and serve in more different ways .
2247###People there are very friendly and helpful .
2249###One time per week on Wednesday , robbish are taken .
2251###That is very good idea , because that robbish undergo a recycling .
2252###All my neighbors in the same way collected garbage .
2253###Every body care about cleanlinees in the front of the house and in the garden .
2254###Especially spring is a lot of colours and pleasant odors .
2260###As I was eaten with my friend Moreno and his father , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina beef , it was very tasty .
2262###The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .
2263###But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will no doubt be back for other dinners .
2265###They have been present in our societies since ever .
2267###Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the exclusion .
2268###Margination has a link with the illegality of this activity .
2269###Also this illegality is the guilty for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .
2271###I think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
2272###But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .
2275###That sounds great , I 'm so happy to hear that you are coming to Saudi Arabia , I 'm gon na be able to see you after a long time .
2276###But unluckily , I 'm having an exam on Thursday so I ca n't meet you but you can take me from the school at 1:30 then we can go to have lunch .
2277###My school is really easy to find , go straight ahead onto Aljameah street then turn right beside the farce of KAU university , after getting down from the bridge you 'll find the school on your right .
2278###So excited to see you !
2282###Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
2283###In that time , it is always sunny and , depending on the region , it could rain .
2286###On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which in that period you can see some migration birds .
2287###If I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain , I would stay one week in each place , and I rent a car in order to move between the cities .
2294###He has yellow skin and big eyes , he is blond and has gotspiky hair .
2296###The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always misbehaving .
2297###His parents and the school principal often punish him .
2298###Bart is energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he hates nerds .
2303###It was one dreary rainy Sunday morning .
2305###Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a while .
2310###" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
2312###At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .
2313###Although , I had n't met him a single time , this letter was his last will and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
2316###Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for last ten years .
2318###I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bother about rubbish things they do every day .
2321###So called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
2322###All the household nearby the public road throws the dirty things easily and even do n't bother about the order of the municipality .
2323###I see all these during my morning walk .
2324###what I feel is that everyone who are staying the town should at least keep clean their own front places and sides surrounds them .
2325###I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .
2326###People are now self - centred and very narrow minded .
2327###Though they are becoming so called educated but in real sense they are still savage .
2331###I am a Tourism student and I need to work at weekends to pay my studies .
2332###I have worked one year in London as waiter in Hard Rock Cafe and 6 months as waiter also in Barcomi 's Cafe in Berlin .
2333###So I have experience in service , costumer care and working long hours .
2334###I Know how to prepare different kinds of food : sandwiches , fish and fries , hamburgers , Italian pasta , etc
2335###I am also very good at dealing with people , I have never had a complaint sheet !
2338###Please , find attached a copy of my CV , which expands on my experience and achievements .
2344###Nowadays , public transport has become a major topic .
2345###The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .
2346###As a matter of fact , car ownership have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport .
2347###The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .
2348###Nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .
2350###There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank .
2351###Similarly , people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
2352###To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it .
2353###There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it .
2355###In general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus .
2357###You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffering because of the rain or the snow .
2358###But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't like to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .
2359###And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
2362###The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .
2363###Sometimes cars are faster then buses , sometimes buses are faster .
2364###Speed trains are always faster then cars .
2365###Speaking about money ? Travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
2366###But , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .
2369###Public transport is absolutely better .
2370###So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .
2375###From my experience working at the International company that organises music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .
2376###I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .
2377###In my case , the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival .
2379###In my case , I had to translate a good amount of texts , and also help English tourists to get around .
2380###Though if you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be disappointed .
2388###This whole business started to get on his nerves .
2395###So yes , the decision is made .
2399###The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .
2400###Mike ca n't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to get the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , Malika 's family and so on , but this is what happened .
2402###At the moment he did n't realise that .
2403###Only after , when Angelina left , Michael closed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake .
2405###I am writing to apply for the post of a summer camp councellor currently advertised on your website .
2406###At the moment I have passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the beginning of my final year .
2408###I speak English , German and Polish and as a councelor it is very handy .
2409###I am very used to dealing with young people as last year I worked at a scout camp .
2410###Moreover , I used to work as a volunteer when still in primary school - once a week I would go to a local club to help children with their homework .
2411###I am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations . I am talented when it comes to entertaining people , which might come in very useful in my role as a summer camp councellor .
2419###I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
2420###I wish to be a great engineer one day so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
2421###I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
2423###School is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronics that are the subjects that I like more .
2424###My teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one day .
2425###The big problem in my class are the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .
2426###The thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .
2428###Coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at the Imperial college .
2429###I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try enter at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
2431###Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calories , the kilos they are going to gain and all that stuff .
2438###Again we ate tacos , but this time they were special .
2440###It means that they have different taste of tortillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipotle , nopal , and walnut , among others- and salsas -tamarind , guava , mango , guacamole , etc .
2441###That day did not finish with the tacos , after a walk in Reforma and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we ate crepes .
2442###Third day was one of my favourite , the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .
2443###La Papa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers baked potatoes with name of famous women and lovely drinks .
2444###Totally recommended !
2445###Mar Azul Resturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitour .
2448###You have to be starving to eat a molcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
2449###Do n't forget to ask for a litter of beer .
2450###Almost a week in the Puerquitour .
2451###The sixth day was to celebrate Magda 's final test , a friend from high school , who already presented it to get the Master Degree ; and the farewell of Vicente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
2452###Because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Memelas Pub .
2453###You ca n't go there and do n't eat memelas , that is like huarache but bigger and very delicious .
2456###Because Vic was almost with a foot in the USA , we spent all day together .
2459###The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied by black beer .
2460###The last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
2464###This kid has been raised by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and his own husband .
2465###Sadly , Pip has no fortune in any possible way .
2466###Moreover , he is just a regular kid with a terrible life .
2467###Beside this , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
2469###Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents .
2470###Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would tend to feel sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like him .
2473###Nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
2477###Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .
2479###Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
2482###However , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
2483###Also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
2484###These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
2486###The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .
2487###Actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house .
2488###The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
2489###And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - natured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
2491###In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
2494###" My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "
2497###" Now lookee here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
2498###what a file is ? "
2502###Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
2508###Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .
2509###The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashback .
2513###The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .
2514###The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .
2516###Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .
2518###Probably , the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster .
2519###I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyard .
2521###I would like to read a story without tale , just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .
2523###This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
2524###Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .
2531###After her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and why did she gave Anna away .
2532###After finding the adoption papers she contacted the adotpion agency .
2533###She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical mother would be a match for a kidney transplant " .
2543###Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
2545###Last summer I went on holiday in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
2546###On the first day I was very angry because my parents did n't take with us Ilaria , my best friend .
2547###But I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Felix Sandman , a Swedish singer , was on Holiday in Sardegna near my hotel !
2549###Unexpectedly , the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
2550###Then , I realised the boy at the centre was n't a simple boy , He was Felix !
2553###Then I went to him and he took a photo with me .
2554###He stayed there a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking him some questions and singing his songs .
2555###When he left I was sad but also really happy .
2560###The walls are covered with trophies and photographs for the worlds best pizza .
2562###My only complaint is there are too many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult deciding what to order .
2563###So far I have never been disappointed .
2564###To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fresh , flavourful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .
2565###As a main dish , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of their pizza 's , all are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
2567###The staff is very helpful explaining the menu to customers .
2568###Also the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks and desert .
2569###I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .
2572###This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different country .
2575###It offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from .
2576###The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .
2577###The Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .
2582###Sports starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young 's minds .
2583###In this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
2586###This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .
2588###The importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
2590###From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models .
2596###It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young .
2598###On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .
2600###They are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .
2601###Dickens and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .
2602###Their realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistic style laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagonists that are psychologically complex .
2603###The graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in European country from 1979 to 2004 .
2604###Of the given source , the overall fish and meat consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .
2605###From the 4 source ate , 3 of them remained a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .
2607###Both lamb consumption and the category labelled beef had a decline trend between 1979 and 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption falling from a peak of 150 grams per person per week in 1979 down to just over 50 grams per person per week in 2004 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams per person per week down to just over 120 grams per person per week .
2608###Chicken consumption was the only source of meat consumption which elaborated stable climbing from 150 grams per person per week to the highest consumption 250 per person per week .
2609###Overall , it is evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose and one remained steady consumption over the 25 year span .
2610###Dear Mr. Merrifield :
2614###Recently he has visited Moscow and while we 've been having conversation I 've mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work on postdoc position abroad .
2615###And since my great interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysis while working in the field of cell biology Alexis told me to try and contact you .
2616###Our conversation with Alexis and your own publications - all supports the suggestion that working in your lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master methodological and research skills .
2617###Not to mention the participation in pioneering study .
2618###My own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell - cell contacts and in actin cytoskeleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells .
2619###Earlier I had a publication in PLoS One with description of dissimilarities in organization and regulation of adherence junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithelial cells .
2620###Thereafter I studied accumulation of various actin - binding proteins and actin isoforms within adherence junction in normal and transformed cells .
2621###On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I 'm going to report on the FEBS - EMBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of september .
2625###P.S. There are my CV and a copy of my paper in the attachment .
2627###P.S. There are my CV and a copy of my paper in the attachment .
2636###Among the most important I can mention San Froilán and Arde Lucus .
2637###From 4th to 12th October Lugo holds its San Froilán Fiestas .
2638###San Froilán is a festival of National Tourist Interest .
2642###During this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again , so you can see Roman circus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladiators and Roman Emperors .
2645###Lugo is and incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and the Roman period .
2647###The town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . "
2649###Despite it , there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town .
2651###The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council 's eco - friendly proposals .
2652###In accord with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .
2654###City X " incinerates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .
2656###The program represents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .
2657###The city has many projects such as the " Keep it clean , keep it beauty " , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas .
2658###Another important one is the " Let 's make it green " , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communal areas .
2659###A later crucial activity are the " Green Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
2660###A municipal waste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .
2662###The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
2663###Most of the " Recycling Worms " problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
2666###Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .
2667###Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
2672###But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
2676###We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
2680###The avant - garde and futuristic projects of houses will be the most desirable .
2683###Sometimes they will be some kind of a modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape .
2686###They will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
2688###Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
2693###At the interview , leaving interviewers a good impression is of great importance . Here're some tips on how to do it .
2694###First , dressing as properly as possible .
2696###Suitable dressing comes across as effective and reliable .
2698###Interviewers have to cope with tight schedule everyday so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's late somehow .
2703###Since you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .
2705###Plus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .
2707###In his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .
2715###Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases .
2720###Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and taking ownership for other people 's mistakes .
2722###Then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .
2724###After that , I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .
2725###For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings .
2731###Have you ever thought about how you can promote your language courses for example ?
2733###According to recent research , there are no doubts that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground gas storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .
2735###Another advantage is that developing natural gas industry equals new jobs what is profitable for people living in whereabouts .
2737###We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs .
2738###Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgrowth in a number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .
2740###The Kosciuszko Institute conducted a research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of shale gas
2743###Choosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices .
2745###Sandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .
2751###Other than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks there , which are extremely fun !
2753###The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few days are going to be enough .
2757###I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice .
2758###The plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .
2759###For the hard work and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .
2761###Another thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night .
2763###What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included in your exam .
2764###For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
2766###I had insomnia the night of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .
2769###If you do n't start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .
2771###I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details .
2772###In the exam , I had that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
2773###Since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before many times , I was able to remember it .
2774###It was just flooding without so much effort .
2776###In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .
2777###Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at ?
2780###The Carbon dioxide emissions is very small .
2781###The biggest threat is the explosion .
2782###However , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .
2784###Energy which we get from sun and wind is still are only a few percent of world energy production .
2785###Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .
2786###When we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
2787###The most expensive thing in nuclear plant is to hire qualified personnel .
2788###Besides , we need something that can work all the time .
2790###If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .
2793###Lima has a multicultural tradition , then in it coincide a complex mix of racial and ethnic groups like mestizos , European Peruvians which are the second largest group and the minority in Lima includes Aymara and Quechua and Afro - Peruvians .
2794###Lima is the best example of colonization , immigration , and indigenous influences such as the stay of Pre - Hispanic legacy with architectural monuments , called " Huacas " .
2796###It is a city that keeps its history through an amazing architecture like balconies , churches like San Francisco Church which has mysterious subterranean catacombs ; el Real Felipe which is the last incredible Spanish fortress ; through their costumes as well as Carnival , this day you can enjoy this particular , interesting and colorful festival because you use water , paint or talc to wet your family and neighbor ; their typical dance called " La Marinera " ; also they keep their history through religion where you discover the religious enthusiasm which is represented by la Procesión del Señor de los Milagros ; their gastronomy is another extraordinary and wonderful example about their symbols , like Mazamorra Morada , el Pisco Sour ( wine ) , el Ceviche , los Picarones , etc .
2798###Archaeological sites , beaches , valleys , natural reserves and the exquisite cuisine give Peru 's capital an authentic personality and sightseeing in Lima is a unique and fantastic experience .
2799###Definitely , Lima is a spectacular and charming city to spend your perfect holidays .
2801###Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've done some research to find out the best savings account for you .
2803###The Phone Bank might give quite a good offer for you .
2804###Firstly , the rate of interest is by 3.1% , which is quite good .
2805###Additionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .
2809###The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bank operations on spot .
2811###You do also get a gift as a new account holder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .
2812###All in all , I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank , since the rate of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .
2813###And doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .
2823###I could n't believe my ears when the phone rang and I answered and they said they wanted me to get at the concert as soon as possible to see how good I was in sound recording .
2825###It 's been my dream since childhood and now I was overwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music industry .
2826###I am glad that they were satisfied with my service .
2827###I can hardly wait for you to see you and to share with my happiness and to tell you all the details of this unique experience ! ! !
2832###Every day as soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning on the slopes .
2836###Little by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .
2839###After six years of rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I 've selected above are not accidental .
2841###The subjects I 've pursued at my high school level such as financial accounting , commerce and economics has given me the opportunity to utilize and put into perspective the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundation .
2842###I 've also participated in various group works and class projects while in high school .
2843###I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .
2844###I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and even professors in order to receive a well rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preferences I 've selected above .
2845###Academically , I 've always been a very determined and studious individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a bachelor 's degree .
2847###I was the president of the Business Students Association ( BSA ) , Head Boy ( senior prefect boy ) and Captain of the soccer school team .
2848###I am a very good soccer player who plays a midfield role .
2849###Undertaking a scholarship and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opprtunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numeracy skills I have acquired at high school .
2850###After I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republic before taking any step in applying .
2851###I found out that Czech Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoing rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
2852###Czech universities provides high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern campuses with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
2853###I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe .
2855###Another major reason why I am being motivated to study in Czech Republic is lack of finance .
2856###Also , education in Nigeria is now a joke as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Nigeria are not safe !
2857###Right now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenges of a university life academically , socially and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business concepts coupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to the any of my proposed university and the Czech Republic Scholarship team .
2858###I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy learning environment for all .
2859###In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the committment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my proposed university in more ways than one .
2861###It is a well - known fact that people need to have communication with other people .
2862###However , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .
2863###They seek solace in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .
2865###Dog 's personality is one of their best qualities .
2867###They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them .
2869###Dog 's optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people 's face .
2872###One of their jobs is to watch out their human family .
2873###So if they sense that their owner might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have caused it .
2876###Dogs are really not that hard to take care of , bathing and grooming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
2877###These pets need a few walks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity .
2878###So having a dog could also remind them to live a healthier life .
2881###So if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay lot of attention to them , because , they truly are man 's best friend .
2886###Luckily , I was fit enough to finish the exercise without having any problem , however , you may need to train a little bit more before embarking on this activity .
2889###You ca n't imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effort!.
2890###Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeing . You are likely to feel scared at first , but your confidence will be built up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .
2893###To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers meet with the safety rules , so you will enjoy a lot without getting yourself into trouble .
2894###For all these reasons , this centre 's really worth a visit
2896###With best wishes :
2905###I had never travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved mother in the city of love .
2910###I am proficient in Chinese languages ( Cantonese and Mandarin ) and have over ten years ' experience in publication industry .
2911###Currently I am working in a press as an editor .
2913###On the other hand , I am also a good team player that can work well with colleagues , presentable with a strong sense of responsibility .
2915###Please feel free to contact me by phone at 12345678 if you would like to discuss my qualifications further .
2919###Education is a milestone in our life and having a good education is the main door to the labor market .
2920###Aware parents disappointed with educational systems and institutionalized education try to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
2922###is a path not suitable for everybody 's cars and that compels us to seek other routes .
2923###Homeschooling should not be considered a wold - wide phenomenon since only a few countries : the UK ,
2924###Canada , and especially the USA , can boast .
2925###There are lots of countries that do not
2926###accept homeschooling as a legal alternative so far and others where it is just an isolated happening .
2927###The situation in Spain can be assessed as " legal vacuum " in light of our constitutional right to free
2928###education meanwhile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education .
2929###Educational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
2932###Now though , before homeschooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadblocks :
2933###the lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up being a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
2934###As far as I am concerned I want to think about homeschooling as a wake up call for educational
2939###Geographic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be surely taken into consideration while designing houses of the future .
2940###Obviously , the future also indicates a home with more technology and very energy efficient systems .
2941###In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .
2942###Steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter .
2943###Environmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawing board .
2944###Built with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be lit by daylight on sunny days , not to mention skylights and solar panels on the roofs , which is more and more popular even these days .
2961###At first , it was only a hobby but with the years it became passion .
2966###Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day and as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stress of our bodies .
2967###In fact , we can see many people jogging and cycling these days whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after .
2968###Despite these two being the most popular sports amongst atlets , many more are just as interesting and profitable .
2970###It consists of a mixture between three different sports , swimming , cycling and jogging and as a result it can be extremely demanding .
2971###What I enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which means I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports center .
2975###You must not push yourself too far .
2976###A gap year between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have not decided what they want to study .
2977###However there are some questions whether it should be everyone or not .
2981###Most of the people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so you can become a better person .
2983###For example , things might gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons such as not having enoff money or not getting a job .
2984###In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all planed and know for shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .
2987###In my third year , I did my internship as a receptionist in a four stars hotel during 2 months and a half in Badajoz .
2988###I already have skills in listening closely to customers and avid understanding of front desk operations .
2990###I am flexible , a good team player , and capable to work under pressure .
2991###My mother tongue is Spanish , but I am able to speak English fluently and I have a pre - intermediate level of Italian as well .
2992###Talking about my interests , traveling is one of the most activities I enjoy , in order to discover new places and cultures .
2994###You may contact me through f8HJ2suL@alumnos.abcd.es or just call me on 659 12 34 56 .
2997###Set in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of Giles , a farmer of the village of Ham who becomes a hero against his wishes by defeating a giant .
3000###I liked a lot this story firstly because I love fantasy stories , especially Tolkien 's ones : they bring me to another universe , making me forget every day 's life .
3001###Secondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional legends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights reveal fearful and incompetent and clashes are won with words instead of weapons .
3002###I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkien 's ironic style , based also on the comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .
3004###I am writing this letter to apply for the position in USA Summer Camp that I saw advertised in our local newspaper .
3005###I am interested in working in the Educational Institutions , or in the Social Care .
3006###I have recently graduated from the Social Science University in Psychology and received high degrees in both my Teaching and Supervising Courses .
3007###In addition we had to have one year of volunteering in Youth Supervising environment in preparation for our finished assingment , so I am able to be a member of your well skilled staff .
3008###Since I was 13 years old , I have helped my parents with upbringing my four junger siblings .
3012###I have a friendly , happy personality and find that I enjoy the chalenges of working in youth environments .
3013###In addition , my studies and experience I have taught me to be accurate and efficient in organizing my work , so I would be a valuable addition to your team .
3023###This can help you to understand that not everyone has acces to many things you do have acces too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .
3024###Besides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that differ greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from one another humans are .
3025###For all of these reasons I think travelling really broadens your mind .
3026###I want to build my career as a fully fledged researcher and academician .
3028###I am mostly also interested to pursue my PhD on Theoretical and Computational Chemistry .
3030###I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugs against several human diseases , as cosmetics materials and as photonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
3031###I also find Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications .
3035###The number of cars grow up rapidly , however the public transport is still in use .
3036###Especially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
3037###In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .
3038###But what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
3039###Well it depends .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .
3040###You do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .
3041###You can listen to your favorite music or radio .
3043###However , as a driver you always have to be careful and watch out on the route .
3045###It allows you to see much more in your pace .
3047###Think how much you pay for a petrol nowadays .
3048###Consider as well how many days do you have for vacations .
3050###Being back to our everyday life .
3051###Most of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .
3052###What if we use the public transport to get to work ?
3053###Well , then you do n't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the way to work .
3054###Simply , you can use the way to work as an additional time for yourself .
3057###And if the ecology is important for you just think about the pollution .
3062###Why using the first narration ?
3063###The first narration can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the friction and makes the readers get into the thoughts of the madman easily .
3064###We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this friction , the author invited us know what inside the madman 's mind .
3065###Feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like really happened .
3067###How does the author create a word of horror to his readers ?
3068###The author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of heartbeats .
3069###First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging the images in their mind .
3071###Then comes to the sound , the heartbeats .
3073###Every time when the sound of heartbeats started arousing , something ensued .
3075###The second time when madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corpse .
3076###At the same time , the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .
3078###The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the crime , the madman 's used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
3079###The sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty , leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
3081###" Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there " , Max told to his friends one sunny afternoon .
3083###When they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits and deer .
3085###They ran quickly , crossed the river and they reached the place where the animal was."It 's a deer ! , its leg is in a trap " , Max 's friend shouted .
3087###By this decision , Max took courage to open the trap , but the deer did n't move because its leg was injured .
3089###Max cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure the animal .
3091###When the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
3093###Probably not , but they are many people in show - busines or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .
3094###Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandalising private life .
3095###If you decide to became famous because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi .
3096###There is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not important what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .
3100###Paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people 's children , that may have negative influence on their emotional development .
3103###And when finally paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .
3104###Summarizing , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
3105###And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
3110###I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to having fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week .
3111###In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service .
3112###We faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table served for us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking ( just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still on the table ) .
3113###For my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at " Las Ficheras " before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .
3116###" Pistola y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food , with lower prices and a great service .
3125###In my case ... I 'm much better now . I 'm settled back home and I 'm up and running , even though my uncured sprained ankle has gone worst .
3126###Last week I was borrowed an ankle support and some crutches , so ever since then it 's going better .
3128###So I should be back on jumping around in no time :) .
3130###The course and the organization left much to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not the ones of the ( only ! ) TWO other participants ) , was not sufficient to cover all the costs ! :/
3133###Back home , everything started fast -I should have gotten used to by now , should n't I??- .
3135###I have been totally immerse in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific paper for a former student of mine .
3137###* Sorry , I 'm gon na ( ab)use of your native language skills once again : here " not meeting his expectations " , could be substituted by another expression .
3138###What I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be good enough , measure up , make the grade ; be up to standard / the task .
3140###From Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I was not counting on , proved itself to make wonders ! ! !
3141###I decided to get back home ( I had been the whole week at my friend 's place , as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the writer 's house , where I had been going every day last week ) , and I started getting things done . Plus I gave a rest to my ankle , which was very much needed too !
3142###The two - day one - night trip with my mother and sister went quite well .
3143###The place we were visiting was very beautiful , and haven't been because of the limitations for my ankle , we would have gone for a short hike .
3146###About the pictures from Ramla , could you wait a bit more time ?
3147###I haven't find time to download the pictures ( from ALL THE THINGS that I need to sort out , I was ( and is ) definitely NOT a priority .
3148###Do remind me again , thou , if you see that I 'm forgetting , okay ?
3154###Receive a big hug from ( YES , FINALLY ! ! ) warm Spain .
3156###The Guardian 's article " World 's climate about to enter ' uncharted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the problems of global warming .
3157###Referring to scientists at the British Met Office , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences on the future .
3158###The World Meteorological Organization made known publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels .
3161###Stephen Belcher , director of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , Amber Rudd , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics due to its consequences on economy , global security and the fight against poverty .
3162###She stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .
3164###Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , heatwaves , water stress and loss of harvests .
3166###Despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass grew in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this prognosis will come true according to Prof Andrew Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies .
3167###Although the NASA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
3172###Their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
3174###The World heritage list is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
3175###It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants ; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history .
3178###Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole .
3179###Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
3180###Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
3182###The Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they ca n't protect them for risks .
3183###Moreover they remind in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance .
3184###In my opinion the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria should be protect for UNESCO .
3185###It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new way to finance and defend the natural and cultural heritage .
3188###It 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
3190###It also teaches us how to overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of others strength to succeed as a team .
3191###I started playing cricket since my early childhood .
3192###Even when I was a kid I started playing with boys of much higher age than me .
3198###Apart from his cricketing skills I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations .
3203###Reading biographies of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in deep .
3205###But I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread its wings all across the world and once again give its lovers a magnificent show .
3206###I met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my Bucket List ?
3207###I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way .
3210###I think is kind of sad , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
3211###About two weeks before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called " The fault in our stars " .
3212###It 's about a teen couple who are diyng because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
3213###This movie has touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without apprecciate the really important things .
3214###So after watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thinking about my life .
3216###Before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I need to do other things .
3217###It is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .
3220###However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
3221###Peoples lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .
3222###Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that word means .
3223###It is a ciclical process .
3224###Rome had its hayday in the first century AD , but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past .
3226###And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
3227###No one can assure such a thing .
3229###I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Ages .
3230###But let 's pick the World War hypothesis for a second .
3231###A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from now .
3232###But there 's , at this day , prospects for a new World War ?
3234###The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .
3235###One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some country declare war to another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have its roots in much older times .
3236###As the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have happenned already .
3249###In this Camp parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .
3250###In addition , the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in safety .
3251###There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sport activities !
3252###There are two swimming pool , two tennis court , one football pitch , canoeing courses and so on but what I like most is the scuba diving , and the equipment is provided .
3253###The Camp is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks , it always get overbooked for the period my parents can take days off , what do you think coming with us from the 1st august to the 15th ?
3255###Best wishes .
3259###Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .
3260###I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .
3262###Instead she started crying .
3267###I was very bemused by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
3274###It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .
3276###They helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters .
3277###Sometimes , they became very rich .
3280###Today , most of them are hosting cafés , shops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
3282###It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .
3283###Recently , several of the buildings have been restored and we can now better see their beautiful gilding and carvings .
3286###The first Castle , called palatium , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .
3287###During the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably famous arcaded coutyard .
3288###During the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments , as well as Royal Private Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Polish ' kings collection .
3289###Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were stored , and armoury .
3290###Apart from the featured , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .
3291###While visiting Wawel Royal Castle one can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .
3294###Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and for certain it will be a memorable experience .
3296###I think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and tough lessons .
3297###My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .
3298###Moreover , I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .
3300###Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
3301###One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
3302###I decided to enrol for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .
3303###Along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers .
3304###And there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .
3306###In the same way I had the ideas and the words but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish writing .
3308###Everybody say it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't rembember is that it could be also the worst .
3309###Adolescence could be compared to a foggy path and even when it seems you can see something threw it , in reality you do n't .
3310###This awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions .
3314###As I said adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that get under our skinn is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .
3316###We 're confused , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and they 're surprised when we get mad at them !
3317###It 's true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .
3318###I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .
3319###Love : That 's a new feeling that adolescents have to face .
3320###It 's not the usual love they 're used to feel , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .
3322###That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall usleep at night .
3323###It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .
3324###Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the dark .
3328###Here , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .
3329###On the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
3330###In the municipality of Artà you will find a coaster town , situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .
3331###Sa Colònia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village .
3335###You will ride until Ca los cans , one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca .
3337###For that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .
3338###As Machado said " se hace camino al andar " .
3339###It means that the most important is the way , the journey .
3340###Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .
3341###On the way to Ca los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
3343###Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored .
3346###There you can practise different sports .
3347###It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea urchins and seaweed .
3349###A part from sports , you should note two different culture points .
3350###On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms .
3351###On the other hand , there is a prehistorical tower called " Talaiot " .
3358###I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favour : Please , keep the secret .
3367###Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
3373###The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .
3374###Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
3379###Travalling by car is also much more convenient .
3380###Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
3383###Students , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
3384###Secondly , cars can also turn into public transport .
3387###Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .
3389###In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens of years .
3396###In conlcusion we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
3397###Boxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason .
3399###All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight .
3401###There have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks .
3402###This is just from the elite few , and there s more from those below them .
3403###More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .
3404###The sport would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .
3406###Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people , the new boxers could be even more at risk .
3407###Once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .
3408###change the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not detract form the entertainment .
3409###There are all sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the boxers skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch .
3410###Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .
3411###Many other sports are more dangerous than boxing , motor sports and even mountaineering has risks that are real .
3415###However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
3417###In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
3420###Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .
3421###This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
3423###Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurence is for some good .
3427###For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
3428###Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother .
3429###Voltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .
3430###The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to .
3431###On arrival they see starvation and death .
3436###Candide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
3437###Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
3440###He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues .
3443###She has become ugly and grew worse by the day .
3445###Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cunégonde but at the price of her looks and personality .
3446###Voltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope .
3450###They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
3451###A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
3453###In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .
3456###We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
3457###The supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged .
3460###The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented .
3461###But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully intergrated with Europe .
3462###Even now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile world .
3464###It seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .
3465###Whenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of war of extreme distrust .
3466###Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her oversees empires than with anywhere else .
3467###In the latter half century though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
3469###For instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is judge made law .
3471###There is very little European influence on our law , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will display many differences .
3472###With the creation of a single Europe , new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
3473###The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent .
3476###The country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
3479###Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .
3483###There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept .
3485###If the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .
3486###The problem facing the British , really results from their isolated past .
3487###The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of losing it are very great .
3488###Whether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries .
3491###This loss need not however be negative .
3492###In fact , in political , economic and defence terms I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .
3493###Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
3494###Throughout the world a wind of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .
3495###This process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process .
3496###It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world order .
3499###In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .
3500###As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf , European cooperation in the field of defence can be both impressive and effective . Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central body .
3503###In political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain like the rest of Europe is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population composition .
3508###E.R.M. is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful .
3509###Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates , and inflation while raising growth , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle .
3513###Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .
3514###If we miss the boat I think we will drawn before the next boat comes .
3517###When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concerning Britains relationship with Europe .
3518###When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market , the debate flared up again , but over how far Britain should be integrated .
3520###The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
3523###Trade will be easier , with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .
3527###Further changes are forecast for Britain , effecting day to day matters , to create a " European Standard " .
3530###Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels ? .
3535###As the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase .
3542###We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .
3545###Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
3549###Firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
3553###Simplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .
3555###Ideally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .
3568###The fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
3570###It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy .
3573###The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
3575###However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
3580###Firstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
3581###These superpowers were economically , militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .
3582###Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European " civil wars " . Thirdly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .
3587###The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
3588###All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
3589###This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting , not majority voting .
3590###Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm .
3591###The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity .
3594###On Britains roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .
3595###The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold - ups and traffic jams ..
3596###To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , with mixed reception .
3598###The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
3600###People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas .
3602###The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
3603###If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times .
3604###Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride .
3607###The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .
3608###The basic dilema facing the UK 's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .
3609###This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UKs transports network .
3610###The biggest worry to the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities .
3611###Most large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing major conjestion in Rush hour periods .
3612###Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheep to commuters , clean , easy and efficient then it could take the strain of the overloaded British roads .
3615###Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and forming acid rain . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .
3616###In concluding I wish to propose clean , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
3617###The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the western worlds population .
3618###If every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourselfs in a 10 mile tail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in such ameander .
3619###To illistrate my point , if every time you took a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .
3621###The answer most likly lies in 2 areas , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that " it is their right to travel in such a mannor ' .
3623###I am by far and away no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tipee 's and eat soya bean soup , however I do agree that somthing should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .
3624###The governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads it just to back move , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , thent more and more people are now driving .
3627###Do we , the westeren world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost ?
3628###Just beause we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit earilene to catch public transport .
3629###Even if we did , then shorly so does the rest of the world .
3630###That could have disasterous implications .
3631###The 2nd reason , is the promblem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .
3634###This has now been intensifyed with the sale of the railways , to privite rail companys , profit motivated .
3635###The vital , small rail links may now be closed , priviously they where subsudised to make up the loss , now the privite companies can not afford to do this so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
3636###The only way to stop the circle will be to break it , the only people to do this is the government or ourselves , If we make the effort to use public transport it will expand into a good service ; Unfortunatly the public seam to be appethetic to this idea .
3637###Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.V. channels competeing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money , this is a big business .
3638###Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which Britain can still hold to head high .
3646###During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
3648###During fights doctors a kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required .
3652###Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .
3658###Although throughout the years rules have been made to dilute the sports sadistic side , should boxing be banned ?
3661###In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .
3662###The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points .
3663###But there is one exception - the original example , the first reference why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank ( the man who does n't specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out ) .
3665###The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' safer having rungside doctors , banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
3668###A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again the forefront of discussion .
3672###The excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .
3673###The money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some top boxers earning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mike Tysons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising how important the sport can be to some .
3674###Let us consider ' Sky ' viewes , recently beginning a subscription to view Tysons " next Live Lights " .
3676###Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .
3678###The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests againt boxing .
3679###How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .
3680###This hypocritical view is shoved by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future .
3682###The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact , none than that , a tax on the poor .
3683###The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .
3686###My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreign firms , for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot .
3691###For example 3 million pounds were given to Eton college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the royal opera house .
3692###The lottery seamed to be a reverse Robin Hood : stealing from the poor to give to the rich .
3693###The lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .
3695###It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so called charities .
3696###It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unlikely .
3697###It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had runed their life , alenating them from friends and family .
3698###In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .
3699###I would also remove any american buisness interests and give the charity money to more diserving ' charity ' .
3704###The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations .
3705###This has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through equations , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .
3714###However , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .
3716###Also , computers can break down , and then a human is needed to take control - such as an airline pilot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they are often among the simplest .
3719###The world watched in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the images of the TV , expecting something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you heard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " After all this time ! " , " I never thought it would happen .
3720###" We all felt that we were living one of those historic moment that you read about in a history book and were proud to be a part of it -- It was November 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wall fell in Berlin-
3722###But for me , this had been the start .
3723###It was the start of what our now as - President Bush likes to refer to as " our " winning of the Cold War --
3724###It was the event that gave the people of the Eastern Bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in vain -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a communist regime that had not allowed them to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .
3725###Some had been executed -- I had a classmate whose father had escaped from Hungary -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and had set out for Western Europe with little money .
3726###I had asked him once if he had n't been scared , scared of what he would find once he left --
3727###He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany --
3728###Bolstered by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungary , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Roumania rose against communist regimes as well -- Now , three years later , communism as we once knew it no longer exists .
3729###Whether the people are happier or not , I can not say --
3731###Their struggles and hopes of forty years will not have been in vain -- Without the " events of Berlin Wall " history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
3732###However , history can not be rewritten and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Wall actively contributed to the resurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bloc -- As such , it was the catalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the other significant events , we will always remember the day the wall fell --
3737###The use of the means humans have developed is wherein the greatest problems lie .
3738###Alone , they do not threaten us , but when they become welded with certain aspects of and certain people in our societies , they become potentially the most dangerous things that we hold in our hands .
3739###Speaking from my experience living in the United States , I have come to feel that technology has become a large detriment to our youth in particular .
3742###In schools , Geography classes rarely , if ever , exist .
3745###Science and technology have had effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people have adopted the same " I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any help " type of mentality that will slowly destroy us .
3747###Until I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at that time I had only one choice of languages- German .
3748###Since I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
3752###It is true in a way , the development of portable calculating machines ( calculators ) has meant that we no longer need to be able to work out sums in our heads , but at what cost ?
3759###When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you hear many funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and will eventually rule us .
3762###Human brains still work out how to build the computers , how to program them and , more importantly , how to control them .
3763###As for making the human brain redundant computers can help to improve learning skills , they can teach , test and improve our linguistic skills .
3769###Computers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in the past which filled whole rooms .
3773###When calculators came along a drop in ability of students for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations .
3775###Computers encourage laziness in the general public , why work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you .
3776###This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
3784###Computers can offer escape from the hum - drum routine of daily life by means of games but they are mind - numbing and un - inventive .
3785###There is however a more dangerous threat from computers , it is that they can do the work for man .
3788###The repetion of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .
3790###There will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly ever talk and the only career available would be for computer programmers .
3791###I agree that computers are helpful but people should not live through their computers and be so reliant on them .
3793###Also , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by hand and calculators and computers should only be used minimally in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer addicts and again have normal people .
3795###These include : the erasion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield crops .
3797###However , many people dislike or are prejudiced against , genetic manipulation .
3798###Partly this is a ' Fear of the unknown ' ; something which tampers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore provokes fear .
3799###What people have also become aware of , is the immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
3804###Whether it be a kitchen - knife used to stab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocate .
3806###Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knife or car , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standards .
3807###Certainly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen - knife responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is put to misuse .
3808###The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hut ' existence .
3809###Scientific research is not a corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition for bettering itself .
3810###The other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility , Science is a process of discovery rather than creation , ie .
3811###no - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .
3816###But , once genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the originals scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other 's misuse of it .
3817###There are many problems facing the Monarchy .
3819###The divisions in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of the divorce .
3821###Another problem is that people think that Monarchy is abolishing in many countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolished in this country too .
3822###There are also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy too .
3823###For example many people like the royal family or they are honest people not like the politisions that always lay .
3824###I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradition in UK and anywhere in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
3825###In the end I think if many people want the Monarchy to be ablished a general election should be called and then see if Monarchy should be abolished .
3826###" In Vitro fertilisation " is the fertilisation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a testube .
3828###Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
3829###Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy .
3830###This usually leads to multiple births ie .
3831###twins , triplets etc .
3832###There are people who are agains this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception .
3833###There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who is n't ?
3834###, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example .
3836###Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation .
3838###Technology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind .
3839###I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie .
3841###The menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby .
3842###Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .
3843###I do n't think this is fair or morally correct to the child since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably die while the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried out to check the mother is not past the menopause .
3846###The foetuses will have been aborted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities .
3848###Science has moved on dramatically since the C19th .
3850###People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even lung transplants , there are many complications but many are succesful .
3851###People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or , a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells .
3852###All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .
3853###Bodies can start their days in a test tubes .
3855###This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together .
3856###The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed , the baby is then inserted back in to the mother .
3857###The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally .
3858###This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
3859###An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
3861###Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her .
3862###It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
3865###As the fetous begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
3867###The women has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromosomes .
3868###The way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperms nucleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosome .
3870###If the mother wants a boy Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .
3873###Also what happens if most people the year you are born are men and you are a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .
3875###The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB .
3876###This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .
3877###In cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat .
3879###It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers .
3880###The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
3881###However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
3882###Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB .
3883###These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell .
3884###With global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of it 's safety .
3885###Although British farmers have learned to diversits , Dairy farming and the sale of Beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain .
3886###Wether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
3887###People throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy , or BSE .
3893###It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise , or whether awareness of the condition is heightened , but more cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .
3895###However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beef .
3897###The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious , where everybody to boycott beef products .
3898###To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remains sceptical .
3899###If beef continues to fall from favour , then the beef industry 's future would be unclear .
3900###Beef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies , fruit gums , and of course stock cubes .
3904###For beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .
3907###Personally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .
3909###Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , thankyou .
3911###BSE is a disease in cows that effects their brain and spiral tissue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .
3912###After a few reported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is know thought that ' mad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
3914###This claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .
3915###Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
3916###Although scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef .
3917###customers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costs .
3918###As you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu .
3919###An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest , pure beef and contain no offal .
3924###Because of this the prices of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
3925###So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand .
3926###As a result they may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cows , etc . or even have to get a government subsidy .
3932###In the 1920s in American , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their investments .
3935###People who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can not buy .
3938###What about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paid miserably .
3939###A migrant work may slave away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a tip at lunch .
3940###The answer this question lies in one 's feelings about Democracry .
3942###A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault ( or bad luck ) .
3943###These opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibly .
3945###For instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make much too money for the work they do , yet none of the doctors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ) .
3947###I agree that in the past women have had problems with societies role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
3948###Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job .
3951###A lot of what has changed women 's roles is the feminists .
3953###These people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do .
3956###What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules .
3957###This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their piers .
3963###The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped .
3967###Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits .
3975###I think that the traditional roles were a good thing , but the modernization has changed everyone 's habits .
3977###Modernization is good , but I think that women should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .
3978###There will be a woman in the presidency , and running a lot more companies .
3984###Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Liberation has been met with adamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
3986###At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .
3995###Women supporting equal pay for women and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shaving leaders of the 1970s .
3996###The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals .
4000###For so many years the good that feminists have promote for women has fallen by the wayside in lieu of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
4001###Like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed was not so jaded .
4002###Within this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a hundred years ago .
4006###Television has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than can not be given by newspaper .
4012###The T.V. has become the center of many households ; in many families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
4014###The more time one spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .
4017###However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrety ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
4018###The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and dificulties .
4020###A discovery that has significantly changed many peoples lives and their ways of thinking is the epidemic , known as AIDS .
4021###Though it has probably been around for awhile , it 's presence hasn't really been known untill fairly recently , and it 's consequences have been devistating .
4022###AIDS has definately had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
4023###It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people which has torn them apart .
4024###For example , there is more of stigma attached to being a homosexual male , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably have AIDS too .
4026###Also , when Ryan White , a boy who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete outcast and would n't allow him to attend school .
4027###With new discoveries of AIDS , paranoia is at an all time high .
4028###Doctors are discovering that some undetectable strands of AIDS do exist .
4031###In the early eighties " casual sex " in the United States was a widely accepted idea , now it is something people really take into consideration and rarely occurs .
4032###Relationships seemed to be valued more than one night stands .
4034###The twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous bloc of time .
4035###Though advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a body of people living in close proximity , has rapidly shrunk .
4037###In my opinion , the discovery and harness of atom and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several lifetimes .
4039###From my experience as an American , I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat , Soviet citizens with anti - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities for underground , and weapons orbiting our planet , with daily , normal life .
4041###In a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvement , and implementation .
4042###As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations , the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana ; from survival kits and basement bombshelters to an ever circulating cheif Executive commandpost from the air .
4046###In America the military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nuclear warheads has virtually arrived a standstill .
4048###With this thawing of attitudes , our frigid planet and cold neighbors may once again be a warm and friendly people .
4049###The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry .
4052###This sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered .
4054###It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
4059###It was now much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses , such as the common cold .
4061###The discovery of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a booming industry comprised of research teams and large companies .
4062###The synthesis of antibiotics and research of their uses still continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
4063###The modern microcomputer ( PC ) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computer in the 1940 's to the computers of today , there have been many technological advances and also there has been a tremendous impact on society .
4064###The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , and other scientific programs , etc .
4065###The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
4068###In offices , the computer is everywhere .
4072###There are of course many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nd and 3rd world countries ) how abundant computers are .
4074###Firstly , computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works .
4078###Granted , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however if that person knew what he should do , or better stated " was able to do with a computer " , he would not have erroneous answers .
4081###Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
4094###( This probably would require understanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
4095###In either case , if computers are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people 's lives .
4096###A large , 1/2 egg , sometimes as large as a small FIAT , with a metal arrow in it 's center has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
4097###The satellite dish , created in the last 0 years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .
4098###In part , it has created The Information Age , as the latter part of the 20th ctry , is often labelled .
4099###Not certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools used in society today , amongst world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .
4100###Ted Turner revolutionized the use of the satellite , with his creation of CNN , the round - the - clock , round - the - world news station .
4101###Presidents and dictators alike switch the channel to recieve first hand information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etats or civil wars .
4102###Decisions , of governmental autonomy , are being made , based on that nights news CNN commentator .
4103###The leaders and presidents of enterprises such as panasonic and CORE refer to CNN , created by satellite dish , on a daily bases .
4106###The creation of MTV in 1980 , has dramatically changed the entertainment business .
4107###The money poured into creating videos , and the profits from viewership- have had a strong affect on the world economy .
4108###40% of U.S. millionares are entertainers .
4109###The Satellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV and naval programs as well .
4111###Naval programs have wasted exceeding amounts of money in the United States , due to the satellite dish .
4113###The creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse .
4114###It has created an information age , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
4115###The pro 's and con 's of the satellite dish are numerous .
4116###The only observation which can be made , is that : It has altered people lives significantly .
4117###It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse .
4118###The discovery of the Atomic energy , is undoubtedly the the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
4119###In 1945 , J. Robert Oppenheimer unveiled to the world his invention in the form that is still most familiar to us today : The Atomic bomb .
4123###For this reason , It is considered the most awe - inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world .
4124###Unfortunately , with each progressive day , the world 's need for this dangerous energy augments .
4128###In utilizing this power in plants and factories we run the risk of contaminating our land , blowing holes in our sky , rendering our seas useless , and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth .
4131###Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have holes in our ozone layer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
4134###The lack of sight from our leaders is almost appalling .
4138###Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversable .
4141###Write your local congressman .
4146###Before the invention of the airplane , long distance traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task .
4148###One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hunger , and threatening weather ; also as noted above , it was extremely time consuming .
4149###Because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world .
4152###Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .
4154###Since the invention of the airplane the world has increased close contact between political systems , and international business endeavors .
4155###The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved drastically the establishment of international trade .
4156###The airplane has also basically speeded up the whole postal communication system also .
4157###Life with airplanes is more rapid paced .
4158###Cars , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and discoveries that have had profound effects on modern day life .
4159###We must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 0th century .
4161###Of course , the issue of feminism is not a new one , but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equality of women ( with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
4162###As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .
4164###Even today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns .
4166###It 's only recently that we 've " discovered " , or begun to think about rather , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use helps to form the image of women .
4169###Only when women have achieved equality with men , will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the discovery will have been completed .
4170###The idea I feel that has most significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .
4172###People are concerned with nuclear weapons .
4175###Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills animals and plants .
4177###Companies are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w / o being heavily fined .
4178###People have also become concerned with nature .
4180###Now , though , we realize what we use , needs to be replaced .
4181###For example deforestation is a very big issue , many groups have formed to plant more trees .
4184###This links 2 issues , one of not producing much nonbiodegradable products and the other of reusing what we have .
4185###( Recycling in a small way also helps those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their collections ) .
4186###Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment .
4189###Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our natural resources .
4190###We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .
4191###We have also become more considerable of our animal life .
4193###We do still raise some for food but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction .
4197###The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
4198###But we are heading in the right direction and hopeful by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
4199###Computers have definitely effected peoples lives .
4201###I 'm able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cluttered w/ paper and records of all sorts , I no longer need to keep these records but only to transfer them to my computer .
4203###Though I have only used a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .
4204###Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to process and to edit things quickly .
4205###For example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month and had to this w/ a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
4206###Of course , this was very time consuming and open to error . W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
4207###Also , w/ the use of the Word Processor I 'm able to edit and rearrange documents w / out altering the entire document , and furthermore , though I have yet to use the Communications program in my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
4208###My father has the same program in his computer and is able to buy on line tickets w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picking up the phone .
4211###How did I get there ?
4213###But , w / out the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University , no doubt .
4214###Instead , once I applied to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assume my info was processed by a computer .
4215###W / out this luxury , the International Programs Office would inevitably inundated w/ paperwork and things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced .
4216###When booking my flight , though I did not do this myself , the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers .
4217###Computers have had a most significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century .
4220###Now , if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening .
4221###While previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - hand accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distortion ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows them to make their own , informed judgment about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions are still strong , and before the action is finalized .
4222###As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sets means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .
4227###Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life seem the good guy always wins , and always lives thru dangerous situations .
4228###However , this sense of reality is not so distorted , and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman .
4230###The waters of the culunary seas have been calm and consistant for centuries .
4231###Progress has move slow like the tides and the constant rythm of the waves have showed little changed .
4232###However with the daybreak of the twentyth century a storm has brewed .
4233###With this storm the waters have churned and spawned a wave that has crashed upon the rocks of every kitchen .
4237###At the dawn of time , cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires .
4239###Technology saw the advent of the wood stove , and later ones fueled by coal .
4240###Modern times saw gas and electric ranges as to staple .
4242###Flame , the source of life , always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughout History .
4247###In an age where time is the scarcest comodity , our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .
4248###A mother who works , can come home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen .
4251###For As I have said before , there is no fire !
4252###This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .
4254###All these were needed to create the microwave which is essential nowadays .
4260###In the 20th Century the machine gun has not changed all that many lives ( except for those that it ' s killed ) , but the invention of radio has made a tremendous impact .
4262###There is one transmitter and it sends its signals through the air , waves , with potential for millions of receivers .
4265###I don ' t think any people of my generation can even comprehend now our lives would be different .
4266###Every morning I listen for the weather forcast and dress accordingly .
4268###Radio , hence , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the news making process .
4269###Newspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident .
4270###Radio gives the ability to reach many more people , instantly .
4271###As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and now more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .
4273###There have even been forms of entertainment , for example videogames , made for this other form of entertainment .
4275###My señora , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her T.V. is the greatest thing in the world .
4279###A current ideology in the United States today is for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written and unwritten rules of society ,
4280###everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and when one does not do this one fails .
4281###One can see these ideas in popular media everyday .
4282###T.V. comercials and T.V. programs project models of how one should be .
4283###In the 20th cen , the values of / that the United States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense when applied to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .
4285###People are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family are often substitued with T.V. In America , this growing individualistic society , one nolonger sees the realitive humanness between people , instead one sees the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessfull , and attribute thier inadequacy to achieve to a lack of effort .
4286###With everyone moving at such a fast pace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass media easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .
4287###The parts of the new machine that need oiled and regulated .
4289###There was a group of scholars in France , l'Academie Français , that set guidelines for French literature .
4290###According to l'Academie Français , all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .
4294###Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
4298###He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys , and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act .
4301###After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .
4302###Candide stabs the Baron , a Jesuit Priest , after the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde .
4303###Ironically , although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating ; and after Candide " kills " the Baron , he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels .
4304###The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Candide .
4306###He attracts the hippocracy of the Church in the old woman 's father being the Pope .
4309###Voltaire makes fun of aristocracy in his description of the Baron , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gentilesse .
4312###According the Lunde , 35% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know .
4316###Today , racial prejudice still exists , but less action has taken place than 30 years ago .
4318###Desegragation reduced some prejudice , but it still exists .
4319###The difference is , today social prejudice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago .
4321###That person would then feel obligated to do nice things back and return favors .
4322###This is based on eauity theory .
4324###Someone who live in the north who comes to live in the south may not be prejudice toward Blacks at first .
4330###He is prejudice toward Jews , Blacks , and Mexicans .
4331###He adopted white attitudes against minorities in the different regions he has lived in .
4332###Our country has been coined a " melting - pot " inferring that we all come from different that we all come from different background but have joined or melted together to produce homogeneous Americans .
4333###But a persons heritage , as we are realizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
4338###They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans .
4339###As Ellie Weisel , author of such books as Night says about indifference : it is the opposite of everything good .
4340###The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .
4341###Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture .
4343###Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it 's writing unique .
4345###For instance , Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment .
4347###African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music .
4351###When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
4352###The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference .
4359###Hopefully we will someday fulfill Elie Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
4371###Some of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows : the Senate V - chip , the House V - chip , a Technology Fund , a Violence Safe Harbor , and a Violence Report Card .
4374###The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television ( Stern 1 ) .
4378###Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised , but how many parents actually watch television with their teenager ?
4379###An exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks ' programming during the 1995 - 1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence ' pervades a significant number of Saturday - morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 ) .
